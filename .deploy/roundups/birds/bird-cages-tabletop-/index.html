Durable, non-toxic materials and secure latches keep birds safe while preserving a neat, attractive display on counters or shelves. Easy-access doors and removable trays speed cleaning and reduce stress for both bird and owner. Consider interior features like varied perch textures, toy hooks, and adequate ventilation to support mental stimulation and respiratory health.
