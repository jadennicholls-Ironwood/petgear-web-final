Durable, non-toxic materials and chew-resistant construction protect health while keeping the cage lightweight for easier handling. Look for removable trays and simple disassembly to speed cleaning and minimize downtime between trips. Select a size and interior layout that suit the species’ activity level and allow perching and stretching. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to compare features and find a travel cage that keeps birds comfortable and secure on the go.</p></div></section><h2>Buyer’s Guide</h2><h3>VIVOHOME 19 Inch Wrought Iron Bird Travel Carrier Cage for Parrots…</h3><p>VIVOHOME 19 Inch Wrought Iron Bird Travel Carrier Cage for Parrots… in Bird Travel Cages aims to deliver balanced day-to-day performance.
