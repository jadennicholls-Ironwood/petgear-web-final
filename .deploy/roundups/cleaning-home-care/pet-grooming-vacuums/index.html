Look for specialized attachments and brush designs that prevent tangles and speed up grooming sessions for both pet and handler. Noise level and ergonomics matter &mdash; quieter motors and lightweight construction reduce stress for sensitive animals and make regular use more likely. Also weigh cordless versus corded power, battery life, dustcup capacity, and how easy the unit is to clean and maintain to minimize downtime.
