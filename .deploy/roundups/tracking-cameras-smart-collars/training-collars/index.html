Battery life and build quality dictate real-world reliability, while app stability and secure data handling determine usability and privacy. Ease of fit, weight, and water resistance matter for comfort and durability during active outdoor use. Integration with fences, virtual boundaries, and companion devices can simplify management for multiple pets or large properties.
