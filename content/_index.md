<h2 id="why-choose-pge">Why Choose Pet Gear Essentials?</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Outcome first:</strong> We focus on fit, comfort, durability, and cleaning because those are the things you feel every day. This helps you avoid products that seem fine on paper but create frustration in daily use. The goal is consistent results that make care easier and safer for you and your pet.</li>
  <li><strong>Clear comparisons:</strong> Each category uses the same core checks so differences stand out and decisions take minutes. Criteria like measurements, materials, and maintenance steps appear in the same order and the same wording. You can move from one page to the next without relearning the layout.</li>
  <li><strong>Evergreen guidance:</strong> We avoid price chasing and star counts and keep attention on features that hold up over time. Fit, build quality, and upkeep habits remain useful next month and next season. This makes the page a reference you can return to when you upgrade or expand your setup.</li>
</ul>
