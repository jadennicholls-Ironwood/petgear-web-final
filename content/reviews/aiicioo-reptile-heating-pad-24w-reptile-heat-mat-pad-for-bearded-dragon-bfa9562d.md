  <p>Aiicioo Aiicioo Side-Mounted Heat Mats are designed for reptile keepers who want reliable belly warmth without sacrificing space or visibility. The unit delivers a controlled heat footprint that encourages steadier behavior, like improved feeding and regular digestion, and it reduces the need to pile heat sources inside the tank. Installation is straightforward, the mat sits at the side of the enclosure and aims heat toward the substrate rather than covering the floor. That placement makes it easier to maintain clean substrate and keeps hides and décor usable without rearranging. Compatibility is generally good for medium tanks such as 40 gallon setups and for species like bearded dragons, leopard geckos, and terrestrial hermit crabs that benefit from belly-warming surfaces. For best results pair the mat with a thermostat probe and monitor surface temperatures with a reliable thermometer. Cleaning is simple, unplug then wipe the exterior with a damp cloth, avoid soaking the mat, and check for wear periodically so performance stays consistent. <a href="https://amzn.to/3
