  <p><strong>Starting a queen in a calm, compact space makes the first weeks far less stressful for both the ant and the keeper.</strong> The Anters Assemble Anters Assemble Queen Test Tube Starter Kits is built for low-fuss transfers, clear observation, and easy humidity control. The kit’s glass tube and snug cotton plug reduce setup friction, while the compact 20mm form factor fits most starter holders and travel cases. Cleaning is straightforward and maintenance is minimal, so day-to-day checks stay quick and predictable. <a href="https://amzn.to/4o0kS9a" rel="nofollow sponsored
