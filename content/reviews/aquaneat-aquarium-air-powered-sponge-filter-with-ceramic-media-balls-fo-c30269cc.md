  <p>AQUANEAT AQUANEAT Sponge Filters combine an air-powered sponge block with ceramic media balls to deliver mechanical and biological filtration in a compact package. The sponge traps debris while the ceramic balls provide extra surface for colonizing bacteria, so you can expect clearer water and steadier water parameters that reduce stress on fry and small invertebrates. The unit fits most nano and small aquariums and works with common airline tubing and small air pumps, making it a flexible option for desktop tanks or quarantine setups. Upkeep is straightforward, rinse the sponge in tank water during water changes to preserve beneficial bacteria, and swap in the included spare sponges when needed to keep flow consistent. For larger systems, use multiple units or pair with a hang-on filter for added flow. The low parts count and plug-and-play nature make it a reliable, low
