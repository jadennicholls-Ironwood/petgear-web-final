  <p>BILLY BUCKSKIN HOME AND BEAUTY BILLY BUCKSKIN HOME AND BEAUTY Dust Baths & Houses is a straight-forward supply for owners who want a clean, repeatable dust-bathing option. The product is a pure pumice sand meant for small pets like hamsters, mice, and degu, and it breaks down oils from fur without wetting or soiling bedding. One clear benefit is steadier behavior during grooming sessions, fewer oil-related matting issues, and less need for spot washing. Another practical outcome is easier setup, you pour a shallow layer into a low dish and place it in a quiet corner; pets typically accept a familiar shallow container faster than enclosed units. Compatibility is broad for small rodents, but very small pups may need a shallower dish to prevent digging hazards. Upkeep is simple, shake out loose debris between uses
