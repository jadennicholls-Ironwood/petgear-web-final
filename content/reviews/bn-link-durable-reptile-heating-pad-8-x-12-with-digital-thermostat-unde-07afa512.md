  <p><strong>Cold-blooded pets do best with a predictable warm side so they can thermoregulate without stress.</strong> BN-LINK Side-Mounted Heat Mats make adding a stable heat source simple, they mount outside the substrate to keep animals off a hot surface, and they are easy to move between tanks. Setup is low friction, the digital controller helps hold steady temperatures, and routine upkeep is quick. <a href="https://amzn.to/3J4L4QS" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p>

  <p>BN-LINK Side-Mounted Heat Mats are aimed at hobbyists who want a reliable external heat source that keeps the floor clear. BN-LINK Side-Mounted Heat Mats fasten to the tank wall with supplied brackets, creating a consistent warm side while reducing direct substrate contact and helping maintain a cleaner environment. The built-in digital thermostat provides repeatable set points so you can stabilize basking and hiding behavior, which can reduce stress and improve feeding consistency. The mat size and low profile make it a good match for standard glass and acrylic terrariums used for turtles, lizards, frogs, and similar small reptiles. For setup, place the mat on the chosen wall, route the sensor per instructions, and set the thermostat to your species' target. Maintenance is straightforward, wipe the exterior with a damp cloth and avoid soaking the mat or thermostat. Users will notice easier daily checks, steadier activity from animals, and simpler substrate management compared with on-floor pads. <a href="https://amzn.to/3J4L4QS" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p>

<h3 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<p><strong>Will BN-LINK Side-Mounted Heat Mats fit my glass or acrylic terrarium?</strong></p>
<p>Most standard glass and acrylic tanks accept the mounting brackets that come with BN-LINK Side-Mounted Heat Mats, but compatibility depends on tank thickness and frame design. Measure the panel and check that the bracket pressure points will sit flat. For very thick or framed tanks, a different mounting approach may be needed.</p>

<p><strong>How do I set up the thermostat and sensor for safe temperatures?</strong></p>
<p>Place the mat on the chosen wall at the level where your animals prefer to bask, then affix the thermostat probe close to that area but not under direct contact with the mat surface. Power the unit and adjust the set point to your species' recommended temperature range, then monitor with a separate thermometer for the first days to confirm stable readings.</p>

<p><strong>What is the proper way to clean and maintain the mat?</strong></p>
<p>Unplug the mat before any cleaning and avoid immersing it in water, the electronics are not waterproof. Use a damp cloth with mild soap to wipe external surfaces and allow full drying before reconnecting. Check mounting brackets and cable routing regularly to
