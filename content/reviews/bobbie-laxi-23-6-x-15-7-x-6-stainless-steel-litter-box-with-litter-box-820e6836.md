  <p>Bobbie & Laxi Sifting Litter Boxes are built from stainless steel for longevity and daily performance. Bobbie & Laxi Sifting Litter Boxes combine a high-sided outer pan, a removable sifting tray, and a splash guard to reduce scatter and speed cleanup, so you see steadier behavior from cats that prefer roomy, contained spaces. The sifting tray lets you lift and sort used litter without scooping by hand, which reduces odor and handling time. Fit is generous, so check your bathroom or closet footprint before installing, and expect the unit to suit large adult cats and multi-cat setups. For upkeep, rinse the tray and pan with warm water and a mild soap, use a soft brush if needed, and avoid harsh abrasives that could dull the finish. The stainless surface resists staining and holds up to regular use, so cleanup becomes a simple rinse and dry routine rather than a long chore. <a href="https://amzn.to/4qcQrOp" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p>

<h3 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<p><strong>Will Bobbie & Laxi Sifting Litter Boxes fit inside a bathroom cabinet or closet?</strong></p>
<p>Measure the internal footprint before buying, the design is roomy and fits many standard bathrooms and laundry closets. The high sides mean it needs more vertical space than low pans, so confirm clearance for both placement and for lifting the sifting tray during cleaning.</p>

<p><strong>How difficult is setup and first use for the sifting tray?</strong></p>
<p>Assembly is simple, the tray nests inside the outer pan and the splash guard snaps into place without tools. For first use add non-clumping litter to the recommended fill level, let cats explore, and perform one test sift to get comfortable with the motion before regular use.</p>

<p><strong>What is the best cleaning routine for stainless parts and the sifting mechanism?</strong></p>
<p>Rinse the sifting tray and pan weekly, use warm water and mild soap for dried residue, and a soft brush for stuck solids. Avoid bleach or strong acidic cleaners, dry parts fully before reassembling, and deep clean monthly if you have multiple cats to keep odors under control.</p>

<p><strong>Are there safety tips for households with energetic cats or kittens?</strong></p>
<p>Place the box on a stable, level surface to prevent tipping when cats enter or exit, and check for any sharp edges on trim before use. Keep the unit away from high-traffic spots where it could be knocked, and supervise kittens until they learn to use the sifting motion safely.</p>

<p><strong>How long do these stainless steel boxes typically last and are they easy to move?</strong></p>
<p>Stainless steel resists rust and staining, so with normal care the box can last for years longer than typical plastic pans. The metal makes it heavier, so moving it takes two hands or a second person, but the build quality means it holds up to frequent use without warping or cracking.</p>
