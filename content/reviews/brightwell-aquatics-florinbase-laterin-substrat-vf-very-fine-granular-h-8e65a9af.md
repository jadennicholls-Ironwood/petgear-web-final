<div id="intro" class="full-width">
  <p><strong>A stable, very fine base helps nervous shrimp feel secure and gives delicate plant roots a quick hold.</strong> Brightwell Aquatics Arid Substrate & Burrow Mixes is a high-porosity clay substrate that cuts setup friction and limits clouding when placing plants or hardscape. It sizes easily for nano tanks or larger displays, and it stays loose so routine siphoning and spot cleaning are straightforward. Bags are simple to portion, so moving or reshaping aquascapes is hassle free. <a href="https://amzn.to/48CmW2j" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p>
