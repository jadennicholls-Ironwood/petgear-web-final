  <p>Copfeu Fleece Pouches & Bonding Pouches is aimed at owners who want a low-friction way to carry and bond with sugar gliders and similar small pets. Copfeu Fleece Pouches & Bonding Pouches pairs a soft, insulating fleece interior with an adjustable shoulder strap so you can keep an animal close while leaving your hands free. Users can expect steadier behavior during vet trips or short outings because the pouch reduces sudden movements and muffles loud noises. The pouch also speeds up day-to-day handling, letting pets grow used to your scent and presence without repeated forced holds. Fit notes: the opening and interior depth suit juvenile to average adult gliders, but larger animals may need a wider pouch. Upkeep is straightforward, machine wash on gentle cycles or hand wash, then air dry to preserve fleece loft. Small exterior pockets help stash treats or a phone, and the lightweight construction keeps the sling portable for travel or quick errands. <a href="https://amzn.to/4hg5z9D" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p>
