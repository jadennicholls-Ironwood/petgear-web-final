<h3 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<p><strong>Will Cozy Castle Cozy Castle Litter Box Furniture Enclosures fit my existing litter box?</strong></p>
<p>Measure the length, width, and height of your current litter box before buying. The enclosure is made to accommodate most standard and many large boxes, but checking dimensions avoids surprises. If you use a very tall hooded box or a custom tray, compare measurements to the interior space to ensure a comfortable fit.</p>

<p><strong>How difficult is assembly for one person?</strong></p>
<p>Assembly is possible solo but it is easier with two people for steadying panels and aligning screws. Expect moderate effort and basic tools, and plan about an hour if you are comfortable with flat-pack furniture. Having a second set of hands reduces the risk of dropped pieces and speeds up the process.</p>

<p><strong>What cleaning and maintenance does the unit need?</strong></p>
<p>Daily scooping of the litter box inside keeps odors minimal, and the exterior only needs occasional wiping with a damp cloth. Remove the litter box periodically for a full clean and to wipe the interior surfaces. Shelves and hooks should be checked for dust, and ventilation openings cleared if needed.</p>

<p><strong>Is the enclosure safe and comfortable for shy or anxious cats?</strong></p>
<p>The covered design creates a private retreat that many cats prefer, which can reduce stress-related behaviors. Ventilation helps with air flow while the enclosed area blocks visual triggers from busy rooms. Introduce the unit gradually, placing familiar bedding inside and allowing the cat to explore at its own pace.</p>

<p><strong>Can I move the enclosure between rooms or apartments?</strong></p>
<p>The finished piece is moderately heavy, so it is movable but not convenient for frequent relocations. It is best to move it sparingly or with two people to avoid damage. Disassembling for transport is an option if you need to fit it through tight doorways or vehicle spaces.</p>
