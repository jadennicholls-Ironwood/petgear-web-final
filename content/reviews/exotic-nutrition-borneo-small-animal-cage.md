  <p>Exotic Nutrition Exotic Nutrition Tall Mesh Enclosures (Arboreal) suits hobbyists who keep tree-dwelling reptiles, small mammals, or invertebrates that need vertical climbing space. The enclosure’s tall mesh panels encourage natural climbing behavior and make it easier to create layered habitats with branches and shelves. Users will notice steadier activity cycles when pets can access higher perches, and caretakers benefit from quick assembly and predictable maintenance routines. The design blends portability with rigidity, so you can move the unit between rooms without dismantling complex hardware, and the wide front doors allow safe handling during feeding or health checks. Mesh spacing is optimized to contain smaller climbers while permitting strong airflow, which helps reduce stagnant microclimates and keeps bedding fresher longer. For upkeep, remove the bottom tray for fast debris disposal, wipe mesh with a mild disinfectant on a regular schedule, and inspect corners for secure fastenings every few weeks. Simple changes like repositioning branches or adding vertical hides can improve behavior and reduce stress. <a href="https://amzn.to/4n7NyM8" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p>
