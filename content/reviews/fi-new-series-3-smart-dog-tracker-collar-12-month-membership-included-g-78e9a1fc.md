The tracker combines reliable GPS with passive behavior logging, so you can expect steadier routines and faster recovery if a dog slips loose.

<h3 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<p><strong>Will Fi Bluetooth Pet Tags fit my dog’s collar?</strong></p>
<p>The tracker fits most standard collars, but fit depends on collar width and the dog’s size. For very small breeds use a slim collar so the unit sits comfortably under the neck, and for larger dogs a wider collar can stabilize the device for better GPS accuracy.</p>

<p><strong>How hard is setup for Fi Bluetooth Pet Tags?</strong></p>
<p>Setup is app-driven and works with both iOS and Android, so pairing is typically fast for anyone comfortable installing apps. The app walks you through account creation, pairing, and initial location calibration in a few steps, which keeps first-time friction low.</p>

<p><strong>What cleaning and maintenance does the tracker need?</strong></p>
<p>Cleaning is simple, wipe the exterior with a damp cloth after muddy walks and dry it before charging to avoid moisture in ports. Regularly check the band and attachment points for wear, and charge on the supplied dock to keep the battery healthy without overcharging.</p>

<p><strong>Are escape alerts reliable with Fi Bluetooth Pet Tags?</strong></p>
<p>Escape alerts are triggered when the device leaves a predefined safe zone, and the system is tuned to reduce false alarms while still notifying quickly. For best results set clear home and park zones and ensure the tracker is mounted correctly for consistent GPS reception.</p>

<p><strong>Is the tracker safe for everyday wear?</strong></p>
<p>The casing is waterproof and designed for daily outdoor use, so it stands up to rain and puddles without special protection. Check the attachment points regularly and remove the device for prolonged rough play if there is any sign of damage to the housing or band.</p>
