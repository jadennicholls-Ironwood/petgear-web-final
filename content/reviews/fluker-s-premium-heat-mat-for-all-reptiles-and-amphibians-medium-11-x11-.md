  <p><strong>Small heat sources mounted to the side of a terrarium can make a big difference for animals that prefer a warm wall rather than a hot floor.</strong> Fluker's Fluker's Side-Mounted Heat Mats are built to sit along glass or wood panels so you get a stable temperature gradient without rearranging décor or substrate, and they are easy to remove for cleaning or seasonal storage. The mats are thin and portable, which keeps setup low-friction and lets you test placement before committing. <a href="https://amzn.to/46XU977" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p>

  <p>Fluker's Fluker's Side-Mounted Heat Mats are aimed at hobbyists who need a reliable, low-profile heat source that attaches to the tank wall instead of sitting under bedding. The design keeps substrate dry and reduces mess because the mat does not contact loose material directly, resulting in cleaner maintenance and fewer burrow disturbances. Users can expect a gentle, localized warm spot ideal for species that bask on perches or cling to glass, and the medium 11"x11" size is a common fit for single-specimen setups or smaller dual-habitat tanks. Mounting hardware is straightforward, so initial placement is fast and changes are easy if your animal prefers a different thermal gradient. For safety and consistent results pair the mat with a quality thermostat and a surface-mounted probe to avoid overheating, and wipe the backing with a damp cloth for routine upkeep. The mat's thin construction helps it conform to slightly curved panels and it draws little power during steady-state operation, which helps maintain predictable behavior from animals that need a stable warm side. <a href="https://amzn.to/46XU977" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p>

<h3 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<p><strong>Will Fluker's Fluker's Side-Mounted Heat Mats fit curved or glass terrarium walls?</strong></p>
<p>The medium 11"x11" mat is flexible enough to conform to slight curves, but very rounded surfaces may need extra adhesive or a backing board for full contact. For glass tanks ensure the mounting surface is clean and dry so the included strips adhere properly, and check contact after a few hours to confirm a good seal.</p>

<p><strong>How do I control temperature for a Fluker's side-mounted mat?</strong></p>
<p>Use an external thermostat designed for reptile heat mats and a surface-mounted probe placed next to the mat on the interior wall. The thermostat will cycle power to keep the surface at your target range, which prevents hot spots and provides a steady gradient for your animal.</p>

<p><strong>What regular maintenance does the mat require?</strong></p>
<p>Wipe the mat's exterior with a damp cloth and mild, reptile-safe cleaner to remove dust and residue, and avoid immersing it in water. Periodically inspect the cord and adhesive for wear, and replace mounting strips if they lose stickiness to keep consistent contact with the tank wall.</p>

<p><strong>Are there safety tips for using the mat with substrate and hides?</strong></p>
<p>Keep loose substrate from directly contacting the mat to reduce fire risk
