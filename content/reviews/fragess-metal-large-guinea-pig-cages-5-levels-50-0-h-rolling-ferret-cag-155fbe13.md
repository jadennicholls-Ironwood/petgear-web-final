  <p>Fragess Fragess Multi-Level Metal Cages suit owners who want a contained, enriching environment for guinea pigs, ferrets, or other small rodents. The cage’s multi-level layout with removable ramps encourages movement and climbing, which can steady nervous behavior and reduce boredom. Built-in casters and a slim profile make placement flexible, so it fits apartments, hallways, and spare rooms without crowding living space. Expect easier daily upkeep from the pull-out tray and wide door openings, both of which cut cleaning time and keep bedding changes tidy. The metal bars and reinforced frame are compatible with common pet accessories, such as hay racks, hideouts, and water bottles, but check accessory mounting sizes before purchasing to ensure a snug fit. With basic weekly spot cleaning and monthly deeper tray maintenance, the cage stays hygienic and durable, delivering steadier pet routines and clearer floors around the habitat. <a href="https://amzn.to/4nUd3Sd" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p>
