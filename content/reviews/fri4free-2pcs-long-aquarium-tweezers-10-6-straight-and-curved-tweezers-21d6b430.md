<div id="intro" class="full-width">
  <p><strong>Feeding small fish and reptiles can be fussy, especially when steady hands and a gentle approach matter more than flashy gear.</strong> The Fri4Free Fri4Free Micro Feeding Tongs put a long, controlled reach and rust-resistant stainless steel within easy reach, so you spend less time fussing with setup and more time on consistent feeding. They pack flat for transport, wipe clean quickly, and hold up with daily use. <a href="https://amzn.to/3WaEMCc" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p>
