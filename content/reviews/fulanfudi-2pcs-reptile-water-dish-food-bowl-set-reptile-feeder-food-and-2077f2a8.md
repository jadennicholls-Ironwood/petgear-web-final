  <p>Fulanfudi Fulanfudi Axolotl Feeding Dishes & Tongs target owners who want a low-effort, tidy feeding routine. Fulanfudi Axolotl Feeding Dishes & Tongs include two shallow bowls and a pair of slim feeding tweezers, which makes separating live or frozen food from substrate much easier. Expect steadier behavior around meals, because a predictable bowl position reduces chasing and spills. The shallow profile keeps food within reach for ground-feeders and juvenile amphibians, while the included tweezers help avoid cross-contamination when switching food types. These dishes work well in planted tanks and dry enclosures, but you may want to add a silicone pad on very smooth glass to prevent sliding. Care is simple, wipe or rinse after use and wash weekly with mild soap for cleaner results. The set is a compact, practical option for everyday feeding tasks, and it keeps cleanup minimal for frequent feeders. <a href="https://amzn.to/4okPrWP" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p>
