  <p>Galápagos Galápagos Scorpion Hides, Cork Bark & Burrow Tubes is aimed at hobbyists who want a natural, ready-to-use hide that adds vertical and horizontal interest. Galápagos Galápagos Scorpion Hides, Cork Bark & Burrow Tubes stands out for its lightweight yet sturdy cork, which provides good traction and breathable shelter, and for its compatibility with common 7 to 9 inch tube placements.
