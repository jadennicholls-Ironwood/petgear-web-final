  <p><strong>Small-scale colony care works best with tidy, calm housing that reduces disturbances and helps a new queen settle.</strong> Handmade Queen Test Tube Starter Kits are simple to set up, easy to carry to a quiet location, and require minimal daily attention. The tubes keep moisture predictable and let you check a queen without moving the whole nest, which helps steady her behavior. <a href="https://amzn.to/4ot6KoU" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p>
