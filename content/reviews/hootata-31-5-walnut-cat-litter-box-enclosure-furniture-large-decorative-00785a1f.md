  <p>Hootata Hootata Litter Box Furniture Enclosures suits owners who want a furniture-forward solution that contains mess and blends with room decor. Hootata Litter Box Furniture Enclosures offers a roomy interior that fits many large pans, and the enclosed shape reduces scatter and odors by keeping litter inside the cabinet. Expect steadier behavior from cats that appreciate sheltered spaces, while the flat top doubles as an end table so the piece serves two functions. Assembly requires basic tools and one or two people to align panels, and the construction includes ventilation slots to maintain airflow without exposing the litter. Cleaning is straightforward, remove the top panel to scoop or lift the pan, wipe surfaces with a pet-safe cleaner, and replace liners
