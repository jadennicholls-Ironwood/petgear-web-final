<div id="intro" class="full-width">
  <p><strong>Night checks, pet spot-cleaning, and quick gear inspections all benefit from a compact, low-glare light that is easy to carry and simple to use.</strong> The iToncs iToncs UV-Free Night Viewing Lights is small enough for a keychain, yet bright enough to reveal fluorescing stains and reflective details without overwhelming dark-adapted eyes. Setup is nearly zero, the clip and ring keep it ready, and maintenance is just an occasional USB-C charge and a quick wipe. It is a reliable pocket tool for regular nighttime tasks. <a href="https://amzn.to/3IRsAmV" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p>
