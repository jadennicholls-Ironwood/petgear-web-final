  <p><strong>A natural, textured backdrop can calm reptiles and hide equipment while keeping a tank looking tidy.</strong> The kathson Background Foam & Cork Panels are thin, lightweight panels that stick to enclosure walls, making setup quick and predictable. They fit a range of terrarium sizes, trim easily for a custom fit, and resist daily wear from humidity and curious animals. Cleaning is simple with a damp cloth, and the panels stay put once positioned. <a href="https://amzn.to/3WLJztS" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p>
