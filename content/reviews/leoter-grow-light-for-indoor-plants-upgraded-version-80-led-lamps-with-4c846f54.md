  <p>LEOTER LEOTER LED Plant Lights are aimed at indoor gardeners who need an easy, low-fuss light for seedlings, houseplants, or small grow tents. LEOTER LED Plant Lights pack 80 LEDs into a slim panel that balances blue and red wavelengths for stronger leaves and more compact growth. Users can expect steadier daily behavior from plants because the built-in timer enforces consistent photoperiods, and the lightweight form factor makes repositioning quick and tidy. Setup is straightforward, most people can hang or lay the panel in minutes and switch between three timer modes without extra controllers. Compatibility notes: the lamp works well above single shelves and short racks, and stacking or angling multiple units is an effective way to expand coverage. Upkeep is also simple, a soft cloth wipe and an occasional dust-off keep light output clear. The LEDs are efficient so running costs stay modest, and the unit’s footprint keeps a clean appearance on indoor plant displays. <a href="https://amzn.to/49bjBr7" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p>

<h3 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<p><strong>How do LEOTER LED Plant Lights fit small shelves and racks?</strong></p>
<p>The slim profile of these lights makes them easy to place on narrow shelves and inside compact grow boxes. They can be hung with simple hooks or rested flat above pots, and the low weight reduces strain on lightweight shelving. For wider plant spreads, use two panels spaced evenly to avoid uneven growth.</p>

<p><strong>What is the recommended distance from plants to the light?</strong></p>
<p>Start with the panel 12 to 18 inches above seedlings and adjust based on plant response and light intensity. Taller or flowering plants can be moved slightly further away to avoid leaf bleaching. Monitor leaves for signs of stretch or burn and tweak the height accordingly for steady results.</p>

<p><strong>How do I clean and maintain the lamp?</strong></p>
<p>Unplug the unit before cleaning, then
