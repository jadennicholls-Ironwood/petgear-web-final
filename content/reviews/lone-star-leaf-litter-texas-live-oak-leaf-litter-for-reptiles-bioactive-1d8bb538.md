<div id="intro" class="full-width">
  <p><strong>A thin carpet of leaves can calm skittish reptiles and create hiding spots that encourage natural behavior, while keeping a terrarium looking lived-in without much fuss.</strong> Lone Star Leaf Litter Leaf Litter & Forest Floor Mix arrives as a ready-to-use gallon of dried oak leaves that trims setup time and fits small to medium enclosures. It is lightweight and portable, easy to top up, and breaks down slowly so routine maintenance is simple. Day-to-day it helps reduce substrate digging and gives microfauna cover for cleaner cycling. <a href="https://amzn.to/42Ks8gU" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p>
