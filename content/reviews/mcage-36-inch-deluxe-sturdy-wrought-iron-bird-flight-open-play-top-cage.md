  <p>Mcage Tall Cages (Glider-Safe Spacing) targets owners who want a flight-style top and a tall profile without sacrificing safety. The cage stands tall enough to allow short flights and vertical climbing, while the glider-safe spacing reduces the chance of claws or tails getting trapped. You can expect steadier behavior from pets that have room to stretch, and easier daily handling because the top-access design offers clear, unobstructed reach. Assembly is mostly bolt-and-slot, so setup is manageable with two people and common tools. The removable tray and grate cut cleaning time, and the iron frame wipes down cleanly for spot maintenance. Compatibility notes: it fits most apartment doorways when measured, but check height and corner clearances before moving through narrow halls. Accessories attach cleanly to the bars, though heavier swings should be anchored to prevent wobble. Over time, basic upkeep like tightening a few screws and treating any chipped finish keeps the cage working reliably for years. <a href="https://amzn.to/48uaku6" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p>
