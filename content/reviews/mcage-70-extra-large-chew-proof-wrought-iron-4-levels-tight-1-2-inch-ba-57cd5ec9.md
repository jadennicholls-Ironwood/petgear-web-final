    <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Multiple doors and removable trays make feeding and cleaning straightforward.</li>
    <li><strong>Mobility:</strong> Removable stand on wheels lets you move the cage for cleaning or room changes.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Weight:</strong> Large metal panels make the cage heavy to lift without the stand.</li>
    <li><strong>Assembly:</strong> Putting together four levels and accessories takes time and two people are helpful
