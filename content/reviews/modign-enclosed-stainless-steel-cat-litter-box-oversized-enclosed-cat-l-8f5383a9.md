  <p>Modign Top Entry Litter Boxes is built for cat owners who want a tidy, low-scatter litter solution that fits medium and large felines. Modign Top Entry Litter Boxes pairs a roomy interior with high walls and a top-access opening that reduces litter tracking and keeps curious pets and small children out of the box. The stainless steel construction resists stains and odors better than some plastics, so you see steadier odor control and a cleaner appearance over time. Expect simple upkeep, the interior wipes clean and the included scoop stores inside or nearby for daily scooping. Placement is flexible, the unit is stable on flat floors and the weight helps prevent tipping. For multi-cat homes, the enclosed design offers more privacy and can reduce territorial marking around the box. If a cat has mobility limits, consider a ramp or a lower-threshold alternative, but for most adult cats this model balances containment, durability, and ease of cleaning. <a href="https://amzn.to/4om8ccw" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p>
