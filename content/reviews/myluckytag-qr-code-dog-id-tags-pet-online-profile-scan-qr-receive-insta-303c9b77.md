<h3 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<p><strong>How do MYLUCKYTAG QR Smart ID Tags work when someone finds my pet?</strong></p>
<p>The tag displays a QR code that a finder scans with any smartphone camera to open your pet's online profile. The profile shows your contact details and any recovery instructions you entered. You can also enable email alerts so you know when the tag is scanned and where the scan originated if location data is available.</p>

<p><strong>Will the tag fit my dog's collar and small harness rings?</strong></p>
<p>Most tags are compact with a universal hole that fits standard split rings and collar loops. If your pet uses a very thin or very thick hardware, check the tag hole diameter before buying. Lightweight and slim designs help prevent extra bulk on small breeds and maintain comfortable movement for the pet.</p>

<p><strong>What kind of upkeep do these QR Smart ID Tags need to stay readable?</strong></p>
<p>Keep the QR area free of dirt and scratches by wiping it with a soft, damp cloth periodically. Avoid abrasive cleaners that can wear the printed code. Inspect the tag often for deep scratches and replace if the code becomes cloudy or damaged to ensure scannability.</p>

<p><strong>Are there privacy concerns with putting my information on an online profile?</strong></p>
<p>You control the profile content, so only share what you are comfortable with, such as a phone number and fast recovery notes. Many owners skip detailed addresses and use a meet-up instruction instead. Review privacy settings and contact fields when first creating the profile to limit public details.</p>

<p><strong>Can I update my pet's contact info after the tag is in use?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the online profile tied to the QR is editable from any browser, so you can update phone numbers, emergency contacts, and notes at any time. Changes propagate instantly, which keeps information current without needing a new physical tag. This makes the tag useful through life events like moving or new caretakers.</p>
