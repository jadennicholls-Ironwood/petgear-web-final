<div id="intro" class="full-width">
  <p><strong>For small mammals that pace or need extra activity, a stable running surface helps reduce stress and prevent injuries.</strong> Niteangel Solid-Surface Exercise Wheels provides a roomy 13.8 inch surface that aims to cut down on tail and foot trapping, while staying quiet for night use. Setup is straightforward and the wheel is light enough to reposition between cages, yet sturdy for regular use, and the solid deck wipes clean easily for low maintenance. <a href="https://amzn.to/3Wd3TV0" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p>
