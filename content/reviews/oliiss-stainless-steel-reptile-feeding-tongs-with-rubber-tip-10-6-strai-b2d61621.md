  <p>OLIISS Micro Feeding Tongs are aimed at hobbyists and keepers who want a steady, repeatable way to offer food to small reptiles and amphibians. OLIISS Micro Feeding Tongs pair a sturdy stainless body with soft rubber tips, which reduces skidding and protects delicate prey from crushing. Expect steadier animal responses and cleaner feeding sessions because the jaws hold items securely and let you place food exactly where you want it. The straight and curved tweezers cover tabletop work, narrow hides, and awkward angles, so compatibility with most terrariums is high. Care is simple, run warm water and mild soap over the metal and tips after use, then air dry. For longer tip life, avoid sharp bending and replace tips if they split. The tools pack flat and fit in a small kit bag, making them convenient for travel between enclosures or shows. <a href="https://amzn.to/3W7I4WT" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p>

<h3 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<p><strong>Are OLIISS Micro Feeding Tongs suitable for newborn or hatchling reptiles?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the slim jaws and rubber tips make these tongs well suited to hatchlings and newborns when you need delicate placement. Practice a few times with dead prey or target items to get a feel for the pressure needed, and always observe the animal's reaction to avoid stress.</p>

<p><strong>How do I clean and sanitize the tongs after feeding?</strong></p>
<p>Wipe away residue with a damp cloth and mild soap, then rinse under warm water and air dry to prevent rust on the steel. For sanitizing, a diluted reptile-safe disinfectant or a brief soak in a mild bleach solution followed by thorough rinsing will work, but avoid prolonged chemical exposure to the rubber tips.</p>

<p><strong>Can the rubber tips be replaced, and how durable are they?</strong></p>
<p>The rubber tips are replaceable on many hobby feeding tongs and will last through regular sessions, but they do wear with time if used on rough or spiny prey. Inspect tips regularly and swap them out if you notice splits or loss of grip, this keeps handling safe and prevents accidental drops.</p>

<p><strong>Are the straight or curved tongs better for beginners?</strong></p>
<p>Straight tongs tend to be more intuitive for beginners since they mirror hand movement and work well for simple placement tasks. Curved tongs excel in tight hides or when you need to approach from an angle, so many keepers keep both shapes to cover different scenarios.</p>

<p><strong>What safety practices should I follow when using these tongs?</strong></p>
<p>Always feed with lights low and slow movements to reduce stress and the chance of a defensive strike, and hold the tongs firmly yet gently to avoid crushing prey. Keep a consistent routine so animals learn to associate the tool with feeding, and store the tongs out of reach of curious animals when not in use.</p>
