  <p><strong>A small hideout can calm skittish axolotls and bettas, making feeding and observing much easier for owners.</strong> The SpringSmart SpringSmart Axolotl Safe Hideouts & Caves is a compact ceramic cave that fits a range of tank sizes, installs with no tools, and stays put on gravel or sand. It cleans with a soft brush and mild water, and the glazed interior resists algae build up. The simple shape reduces setup time and gives pets a reliable retreat every day. <a href="https://amzn.to/4hdRUQE" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p>
