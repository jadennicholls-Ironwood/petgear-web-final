  <p><strong>Background noise and predictable enclosure conditions help reduce stress in amphibians and small reptiles, and a low-effort clean-up crew keeps tanks tidy with almost no daily work.</strong> TC INSECTS Springtail/Isopod Clean-up Crews arrive ready to seed a bioactive terrarium, with minimal setup and compact packaging that fits most vivaria. They cut routine maintenance, help control mold and frass, and are easy to move between enclosures for quarantine or new builds. <a href="https://amzn.to/47vs2fK" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p>

<h3 id="pros-cons">Pros and Cons</h3>
<div class="pc-grid" style="display:grid;grid-template-columns:1fr 1fr;gap:16px;">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Low daily care, they thrive on leaf litter and detritus.</li>
    <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Works well in frog, reptile, and amphibian vivaria with moist microclimates.</li>
    <li><strong>Setup:</strong> Easy to introduce, no complex acclimation needed when humidity is correct.</li>
    <li><strong>Cleaning:</strong> Reduces visible waste and slows mold buildup in substrate.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Density:</strong> Qty-25 may be light for very large enclosures, additional stocking could be needed.</li>
    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Sensitive to high heat, not ideal for hot, arid setups without extra humidity.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>TC INSECTS Springtail/Isopod Clean-up Crews are aimed at hobbyists building bioactive tanks and keepers who want a low-effort substrate team. TC INSECTS Springtail/Isopod Clean-up Crews include a small starter population of dwarf white isopods that feed on decaying plant matter, shed skin, and uneaten food, which helps maintain clearer substrate and reduces manual cleaning. Expect fewer mold patches and steadier microbe activity, which can translate to calmer, more predictable behavior from sensitive amphibians and juvenile reptiles. These isopods adapt to leaf litter layers and cork bark hiding spots, so they fit planted terrariums, paludariums, and frog setups. For best results, introduce them after tank humidity and temperature are stable
