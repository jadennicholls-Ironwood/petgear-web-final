  <p>TIOVERY TIOVERY Airtight Rolling Food Containers is aimed at people who feed dogs or cats from bulk bags and want a cleaner, more portable way to store dry food. TIOVERY Airtight Rolling Food Containers combine a sealed lid to slow oxidation with a rollable base for moving full loads without lifting. You can expect steadier feeding routines because scooping is faster and spill risk is lower, and floors stay cleaner when food is transferred directly from the flip top. The container fits common 13 lb to 30 lb bags, and the interior is wide enough to store a folded bag or a refill pouch. The included 3L small container is handy for travel or portioning, and the scoop clips into the lid so it is always within reach. Upkeep is straightforward, wash the removable lid and scoop by hand or wipe the interior with a damp cloth for routine cleaning. Regular inspection of seals keeps performance consistent and helps prevent pests. <a href="https://amzn.to/3J1AUQY" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p>
