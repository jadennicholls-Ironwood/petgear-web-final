<h3 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<p><strong>What bird sizes work best with VIVOHOME VIVOHOME Bird Travel Cages?</strong></p>
<p>It is best suited for small parrots such as parakeets, cockatiels, lovebirds and conures. Measure your bird from beak to tail tip and compare with the interior dimensions to ensure they have room to turn and perch. Avoid using it as a primary home for larger species.</p>

<p><strong>How easy is the initial setup and packing for travel?</strong></p>
<p>Setup is simple, usually just securing the door latch and placing the removable tray. The top handle makes carrying straightforward and the unit fits into most car trunks or under seats. For added comfort, include familiar bedding and a small perch before moving.</p>

<p><strong>What cleaning routine keeps the cage sanitary?</strong></p>
<p>Daily spot cleaning and emptying the pull-out tray prevents buildup and odors. Once a week wash the tray with mild soap and water, and wipe down bars and perches with a damp cloth. Avoid harsh chemicals that could irritate your bird.</p>

<p><strong>Are there safety tips for using this metal travel cage?</strong></p>
<p>Check all latches and connection points before each trip to prevent escapes. Ensure bar spacing is appropriate for your bird to avoid foot or beak entrapment, and never leave a bird unattended in a moving vehicle without proper temperature control. Add only bird-safe toys and perches.</p>

<p><strong>How portable is this carrier for vet visits and short trips?</strong></p>
<p>The carrier is designed for short trips, with a sturdy handle and a compact size that fits many vehicle spaces. It is more durable than lightweight plastic carriers but also heavier, so consider that for longer walks. Use familiar comforts inside to reduce stress during vet visits.</p>
