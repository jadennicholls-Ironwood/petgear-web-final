<div id="intro" class="full-width">
  <p><strong>For keepers who need an accessible, secure home for arboreal reptiles, a front-opening design cuts the fumble from feeding and maintenance and helps reduce stress for skittish animals.</strong> The WACOOL WACOOL Front-Opening Glass Vivariums makes daily tasks like misting, rearranging branches, and checking hides simpler thanks to wide front access and sliding panels. It fits against walls or stands and moves more easily than full-frame cages. Glass panels give clear sight lines for monitoring humidity and behavior, while the top vents help airflow and lamp placement. <a href="https://amzn.to/42Lj23z" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p>
