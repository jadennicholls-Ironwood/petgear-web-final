<h3 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<p><strong>Will the Ware Manufacturing Ware Manufacturing Solid-Surface Exercise Wheels fit my small cage?</strong></p>
<p>The wheel is designed to work with most small-pet cages that accept mounted wheels.

If your cage has unusually thick bars, a small adapter or zip-tie can help stabilize the mount.</p>

<p><strong>How hard is setup for the wheel out of the box?</strong></p>
<p>Setup is straightforward and usually takes under ten minutes with common tools or the included hardware. Position the wheel at a comfortable height, attach the bracket to cage bars, and test for wobble before allowing unsupervised use. A quick test run with a hand ensures the axle spins freely and the wheel is level for consistent operation.</p>
