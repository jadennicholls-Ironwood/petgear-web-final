<div class="full-width">
  <p>WoofiGo Sifting Litter Boxes brings a metal-first approach to litter care, aimed at owners who want a low-odor, low-fuss solution for larger cats. The stainless-steel pan does not trap smells, so routine rinses and sunlight drying return the box to neutral quickly. High sides and an enclosed lid reduce scatter and accidental spray, which helps keep nearby floors cleaner and can steady a reactive cat's tendency to avoid messy edges. The unit includes a scoop sized for coarse or clumping litters, and the outer lip pairs with many standard liners if you use them. Installation is minimal, only a few snaps or screws in models with a removable lid, so you can position the box in a bathroom or a laundry area without special tools. For multi-cat households, the nonporous metal surface reduces lingering bacteria between full cleanings, and the XL dimensions give larger cats room to turn and settle without feeling cramped. Regular rinsing, occasional mild detergent, and full air drying are all that is needed to keep the box performing as intended. <a href="https://amzn.to/3KPUakV" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p>

<h3 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<p><strong>Will my large or senior cat fit comfortably in the WoofiGo Sifting Litter Boxes?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the XL footprint is designed to give bigger cats room to enter, turn, and dig without landing on edges. Seniors with limited mobility benefit from the wide interior, though the higher sides mean a small step up is required. Consider placing a low mat or step nearby to ease access for arthritic pets.</p>

<p><strong>How difficult is it to set up and move the stainless-steel litter pan?</strong></p>
<p>Setup is straightforward and usually takes a few minutes because the lid and pan snap together or secure with a couple of fasteners. Moving the unit when full is not recommended due to weight, but when empty it
