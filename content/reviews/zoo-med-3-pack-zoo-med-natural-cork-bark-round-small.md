  <p>Zoo Med Scorpion Hides, Cork Bark & Burrow Tubes are a simple, no-fuss option for keepers who want an immediate retreat that feels natural. This pack of small, round cork pieces gives animals a dark, secure nook, and the low profile helps maintain viewing lines for the tank. Expect steadier behavior from shy specimens as they adopt a predictable hiding spot, which can reduce pacing and excessive daylight exposure. Fit is best for smaller scorpions, small spiders, and juvenile invertebrates, so check body length against the opening before buying. Cork is lightweight, so these hides sit without shifting on soft substrate, but they also anchor nicely in a shallow sand or soil bed. Cleaning is straightforward, wipe or brush off debris, avoid soaking for long periods, and replace any piece that becomes waterlogged or moldy to protect occupant health. The natural texture doubles as a climbing surface for juveniles and helps maintain humidity pockets directly beneath the hide for modest microclimate benefits. <a href="https://amzn.to/4hdXKRW" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p>

<h3 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<p><strong>Will Zoo Med Scorpion Hides, Cork Bark & Burrow Tubes fit into a 10-gallon terrarium for a small scorpion?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the small cork rounds are made to fit compact tanks, and they tuck into corners without taking up much floor space. Measure the scorpion's length and compare to the hide opening, and position the hide against the glass or under a flat decor piece to create a snug, secure retreat.</p>

<p><strong>How do I clean these cork hides without damaging them?</strong></p>
<p>Light cleaning is best, use a soft brush or cloth to remove substrate and shed skin, and a brief rinse with warm water for stubborn dirt. Avoid long soaks and harsh chemicals, then air dry thoroughly before returning to the enclosure to prevent mold growth.</p>

<p><strong>Are these cork rounds safe for maintaining humidity around a burrow?</strong></p>
<p>Cork helps trap small pockets of moisture under the hide, which can create a slightly more humid microclimate for species that need it. For species requiring consistently high humidity, pair the cork with a damp hide or increase room substrate moisture rather than soaking the cork itself.</p>

<p><strong>Can I use these hides for transport or temporary housing?</strong></p>
<p>The lightweight cork rounds are handy for moving animals between enclosures and for short-term containment, they provide a quick, dark refuge. For longer transport, secure the hide so it does not shift, and ensure proper ventilation and stable temperatures during the move.</p>

<p><strong>How long do these cork hides last with normal use?</strong></p>
<p>Lifespan depends on humidity, animal activity, and cleaning frequency, but under regular use small cork rounds may last many months to over a year. Replace any piece that shows deep wear, permanent staining, or mold to keep the enclosure hygienic and safe for inhabitants.</p>
