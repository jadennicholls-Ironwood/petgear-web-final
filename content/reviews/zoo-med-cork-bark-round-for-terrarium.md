  <p>Zoo Med Zoo Med Scorpion Hides, Cork Bark & Burrow Tubes are made from natural cork, shaped into round retreats that mimic crevices found in desert and forest habitats. The product offers two clear outcomes: steadier, more natural behavior from animals that feel secure, and less frequent handling during maintenance because the hide is simple to move. These cork rounds are lightweight, so they can be angled or slightly buried to create a snug fit for scorpions, solifuges, and small reptiles. The rough interior provides grip for animals entering and leaves minimal contact scent, which reduces the need for heavy cleaning. For upkeep, wipe away debris and occasionally rinse with warm water, then allow full drying before returning to the enclosure to avoid mold. Because they are easy to trim with a utility knife, these hides adapt to custom terrarium layouts and work well in glass, plastic, or wooden tanks where a natural retreat is desired. <a href="https://amzn.to/49awqC5" rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p>
