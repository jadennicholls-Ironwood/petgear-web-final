<p><strong>Is Zoo Med Sand & Sand Mixes For Desert Lizards safe for all desert lizards?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, this sand is designed to be safe for most desert-dwelling lizards. Its fine texture minimizes the risk of impaction, making it suitable for species that enjoy digging and burrowing.</p>

<p><strong>How should I clean the sand?</strong></p>
<p>Regular spot cleaning is recommended to remove waste and debris. For a thorough clean, replace the sand periodically and rinse the enclosure with a reptile-safe disinfectant.</p>

<p><strong>Can this sand be used in humid environments?</strong></p>
<p>While designed for desert habitats, it can be used in moderately humid environments. However, it may clump if exposed to excessive moisture, so it's best suited for arid setups.</p>
