<p><strong>Lick mats are a proven enrichment tool that can reduce anxiety and promote calm, focused licking for many pets.</strong> When comparing mats for anxiety relief, focus on calming benefits first&mdash;how the texture, scent retention, and treat distribution slow intake and soothe behavior. Practical factors include non-slip backing to prevent skidding, varied groove patterns to extend engagement, and materials that resist stains for easy cleaning. Durability and safe, BPA-free compounds support long-term use and lower the risk of breakdown that can trigger stress. Size and shape matter: choose a mat that fits feeding areas and matches licking style so sessions stay comfortable and calming. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to compare top contenders and find the best match for calming, enrichment, and everyday ease.</p>
