<p>White noise machines for pets are widely used to ease anxiety and create a predictable, soothing background for dogs and cats. <strong>Consistent, gentle sound helps mask startling noises and creates a predictable acoustic environment that calms anxious pets.</strong> When comparing devices for anxiety &amp; calming, prioritize sound quality and variety&mdash;low-frequency and fan-like tones often soothe more reliably than sharp or high-pitched noises. Look for accurate volume control, smooth fade/timer functions, and the option for continuous play so the white noise supports uninterrupted rest rather than triggering curiosity. Practical benefits like compact, chew-resistant design, easy-to-clean surfaces, and flexible power options (battery or plug-in) make consistent use simpler for busy caregivers. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to match features to your pet’s needs and find the most calming fit.</p>
