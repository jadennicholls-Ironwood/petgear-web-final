<p>Keeping axolotls in home aquariums has shifted toward setups that emphasize low water flow, roomy bottoms, and stable temperatures to support delicate gills and behaviors. When comparing tanks and systems, prioritize <strong>stable water chemistry, gentle filtration, soft substrate, and enough floor space so axolotls can move and forage comfortably</strong>. Space and materials matter: wider tanks let axolotls roam, glass or acrylic affects insulation and visibility, and secure lids reduce stress and evaporation. Choose equipment that makes routine maintenance straightforward - easier cleaning and reliable filtration reduce health risks and save time. Extras like quiet filters, dimmable lighting, hiding spots, and compatible decor boost welfare and simplify upkeep. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to compare features, setup tips, and recommended accessories for creating a comfortable axolotl habitat.</p>
