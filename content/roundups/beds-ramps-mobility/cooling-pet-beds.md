For ramps and mobility aids, prioritize gentle inclines, secure traction, and a weight capacity that matches the pet’s needs to reduce strain and fall risk. Consider portability, assembly, and whether the design integrates with existing furniture or travel routines to make everyday use seamless. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to compare features, pros, and practical tips that help choose the right cooling bed, ramp, or mobility solution for your pet.</p></div></section>
