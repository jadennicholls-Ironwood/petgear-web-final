Material choices&mdash;from untreated wood and cedar to PVC and recycled composites&mdash;affect insulation, longevity, and how often boxes need attention. Match entrance diameter and interior dimensions to the target species, and plan placement height, sun exposure, and nearby perches to improve occupancy. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to compare specifications and pick the right setup for the birds you want to attract.</p></div></section>
