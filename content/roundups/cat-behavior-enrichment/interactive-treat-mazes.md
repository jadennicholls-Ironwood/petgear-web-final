<p><strong>Interactive treat mazes boost feline mental stimulation and mimic hunting challenges that reduce boredom and destructive behavior.</strong> When comparing options, prioritize designs that deliver meaningful engagement, slow-feed benefits, and adaptability to different play styles. Key factors include adjustable difficulty, durable non-toxic materials, ease of cleaning, and a footprint that fits your cat’s paws and activity space. Consider refill convenience and maintenance so enrichment stays easy to use daily. Noise, weight, and whether the maze supports single- or multi-cat sessions can influence long-term interest and satisfaction.
