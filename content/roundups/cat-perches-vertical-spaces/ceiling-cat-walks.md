Materials, mounting hardware and surface texture determine scratch resistance, traction and long-term durability&mdash;benefits that keep cats active and reduce furniture damage. Modular designs and adjustable shelving let you tailor routes for kittens to seniors, maximizing vertical territory and encouraging natural climbing behavior. Installation ease and compatibility with studs or common wall types also matter, because secure anchoring protects pets and prevents accidental falls.
