Durable frames and abrasion-resistant fabrics keep contents protected, while thoughtful padding and suspension systems reduce strain during walks or travel. Look for carriers with easy-access doors, washable liners, and secure closures to simplify cleaning and prevent escapes. Size range, weight capacity, and packability affect where and how a carrier performs&mdash;choose the combination that matches typical routes and load.
