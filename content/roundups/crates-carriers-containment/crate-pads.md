Size compatibility and secure anchoring matter for containment: a snug, non-slip pad prevents shifting and keeps carriers stable. Choose materials that resist odors, wick moisture, and clean easily to promote hygiene and reduce maintenance effort. Portability, compatibility with specific crate designs, and removable covers for laundering extend product lifespan and everyday convenience.
