<p>Use this guide to evaluate front-opening glass vivariums from a benefit-first perspective - what helps dart frogs thrive and what makes care practical for the keeper.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Access and door design:</strong> Front-opening doors should allow safe, full-reach access to the interior for feeding, planting, and spot-cleaning. Look for doors with smooth hinges or sliders, reliable seals, and a secure closing mechanism to prevent escapes while minimizing stress during handling.</li>
  <li><strong>Microclimate control:</strong> A bioactive dart frog setup needs consistent humidity without excessive pooling. Prioritize tanks designed for integrated drainage layers, room for substrate depth and a false-bottom, and adjustable vents or removable panels to fine-tune airflow.</li>
  <li><strong>Ventilation balance:</strong> Good vivariums combine sealed front openings with strategically placed intake and exhaust vents to reduce stagnation and mold risk while maintaining humidity. Adjustable or multi-stage vents help adapt to seasonal changes and different plant loads.</li>
  <li><strong>Materials and build quality:</strong> Tempered glass panels, robust seals, and quality framing reduce the risk of warping and leaks. Consider glass thickness relative to overall size, and inspect silicone joins and corner bonding for longevity and safety.</li>
  <li><strong>Plant and frog support features:</strong> Built-in substrate trays, removable planting modules, mounted backing or cork panels, and planted ledges make establishing epiphytes and hiding spots easier. Removable or modular elements simplify replanting and substrate maintenance.</li>
  <li><strong>Compatibility with equipment:</strong> Confirm space and mounting options for misters, foggers, LED lighting, filtration, and sensors. Front-opening designs should allow routing of tubing or wiring without compromising seals or aesthetics.</li>
  <li><strong>Maintenance and cleaning:</strong> Removable bottoms, slide-out trays, and large door openings reduce the effort and disturbance required for regular cleaning and spot treatments. Consider models that allow partial access to avoid disrupting the full microhabitat.</li>
  <li><strong>Visibility and display:</strong> Opt for clear
