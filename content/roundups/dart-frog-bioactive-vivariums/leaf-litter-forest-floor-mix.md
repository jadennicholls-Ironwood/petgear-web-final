<p>Leaf litter and forest-floor mixes form the foundation of a thriving dart frog bioactive vivarium, supplying humidity, cover, and a living substrate for microfauna and plants. When comparing options, prioritize moisture retention, safe nutrient cycling for live plants, a particle size that supports micro-invertebrates, and chemical-free ingredients that won’t harm sensitive amphibians. Durability and resistance to compaction translate to fewer substrate changes and more stable microclimates for breeding and natural behaviors. <strong>Choose mixes that encourage beneficial microbes and detritivores, maintain steady humidity, and avoid added fertilizers or preservatives that can stress frogs.</strong> Aesthetic considerations - leaf type, color, and decomposition rate - matter too, because they influence hiding spots and nutrient turnover in planted setups. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to compare composition, particle profile, and care tips to select the right forest floor mix for your dart frog habitat.</p>
