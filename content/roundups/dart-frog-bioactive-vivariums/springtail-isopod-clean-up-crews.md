<p><strong>Healthy springtail and isopod clean-up crews are foundational to stable dart frog bioactive vivariums, recycling waste into nutrients and helping suppress mold.</strong> When comparing clean-up crew options, prioritize species compatibility, reproduction rate, and feeding behavior to support frog health and substrate stability. Look for hardy springtails and isopods that tolerate high humidity, low disturbance, and coexist with frogs without becoming a visible nuisance. For dart frogs, crews that enhance nutrient cycling, keep leaf litter clear, and minimize pathogen growth deliver the biggest practical benefits with minimal intervention. Practical factors such as ease of sourcing, enclosure size, and starter colony size affect setup and long-term balance. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below for concise buying considerations and setup tips to choose the right clean-up crew for a thriving vivarium.</p>
