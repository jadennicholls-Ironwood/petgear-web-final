Practical features like easy-tie handles, scent-free or lightly scented options for odor control, and compact rolls that fit common dispensers make everyday use simpler. Also consider packaging and manufacturing practices to minimize overall environmental impact and whether bags break down in backyard compost versus industrial facilities. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to compare key features and pick bags that balance sustainability, reliability, and walk-time convenience.</p></div></section>
