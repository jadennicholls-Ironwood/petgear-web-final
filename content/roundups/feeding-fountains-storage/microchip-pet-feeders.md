For fountains, look for filtration and flow patterns that encourage hydration while minimizing maintenance; for storage, focus on airtight seals, capacity, and pest-resistant construction to keep kibble fresh. Compatibility with existing microchips, ease of cleaning, battery and power flexibility, and smart notifications also matter for long-term convenience and pet safety.
