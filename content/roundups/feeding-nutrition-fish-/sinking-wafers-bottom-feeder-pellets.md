Ingredient transparency and species-specific formulations help match diets to digestive needs and preserve water quality. Physical factors&mdash;pellet size, hardness, and disintegration rate&mdash;affect consumption rates and tank maintenance, so choose forms that suit mouth size and feeding habits. Also consider packaging that preserves freshness, clear feeding guidelines, and compatibility with supplemental foods to support a balanced regimen. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below for concise comparisons, direct links to in-depth reviews, and buying options that fit specific bottom-feeder needs.</p></div></section>
