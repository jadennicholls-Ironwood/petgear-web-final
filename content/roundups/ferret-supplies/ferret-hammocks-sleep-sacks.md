<p>Ferrets can sleep up to 18 hours a day, so bedding that supports burrowing and temperature regulation is essential. <strong>Choose hammocks and sleep sacks that balance softness, durability, and easy cleaning to support comfort and hygiene.</strong> When comparing options, prioritize fabrics that wick moisture and resist odors to keep enclosures healthy and inviting. Secure attachment systems and reinforced stitching reduce the risk of falls and extend product life, which is particularly important for active chewers. Size, accessibility, and whether a piece offers hiding space versus open lounging affect how often a ferret will use it and how comfortable it becomes. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to explore top choices and find a setup that keeps small sleepers safe, warm, and content.</p>
