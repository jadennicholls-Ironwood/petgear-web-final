<p><strong>More ferret owners are switching to high-sided, low-scatter litter boxes to cut down on tracking and simplify cleanup.</strong> When comparing ferret litter boxes, prioritize containment that reduces scatter, an entry height that matches the animal’s comfort, and materials that resist staining and odors. Durable construction and secure lids mean less tipping and longer lifespans, while smooth, non-toxic plastics make disinfecting quick and safe. Consider compatibility with pellet-style litters and liners, plus ventilation and design features that help control smells for a fresher living area. Size and stability matter too&mdash;choose a box with enough interior room for natural movement and a low enough lip for older or recovering ferrets to enter easily. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to compare features, build quality, and cleaning convenience so you can pick the right ferret litter box for daily care.</p>
