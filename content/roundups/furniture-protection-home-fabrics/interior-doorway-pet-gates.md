Mounting style matters: pressure-mounted designs preserve trim and paint, while hardware-mounted units deliver greater stability for larger pets. Look for adjustable widths, sufficient height, and smooth, rounded edges or padded panels to prevent fabric pulls and accidental scuffs. Ease of cleaning and removable, washable components help keep fabrics fresh and extend the long-term look of indoor textiles. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to compare specs, read in-depth reviews, and select the gate that best protects furniture while matching home fabrics and décor.</p></div></section>
