Hypoallergenic and fragrance-free choices help sensitive animals stay comfortable, while enzymatic or oatmeal-infused blends can target excessive shedding and odor at the source. Application ease&mdash;spray, foam, or powder&mdash;and how well a product brushes out are practical factors that determine grooming speed and salon-quality results at home. Packaging that minimizes mess and clear usage instructions reduce stress for both pet and handler during touch-up sessions between baths. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to quickly find recommendations matched to coat type, skin sensitivity, and shedding needs.</p></div></section>
