Look for deep substrate layers and varied climbing surfaces to encourage natural behaviors and reduce stress. Durable, non-toxic materials and reliable ventilation make daily care simpler while minimizing risks of mold and respiratory issues. Consider how the layout supports enrichment&mdash;hiding spots, tubs for soaking, and culverts for exploring help keep crabs active and healthy.
