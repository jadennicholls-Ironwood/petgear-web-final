Padding, swivel hardware, and breakaway features all translate to less strain on hands and a more comfortable experience for pets. Fit matters too: collars and harnesses should prevent slipping without restricting movement, while leash ergonomics help maintain control without fatigue. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to find detailed strengths for different styles and pick the one that fits walking habits and dogs' sizes.</p></div></section>
