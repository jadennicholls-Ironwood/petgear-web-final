Comfort and fit for collars and harnesses protect skin and fur while keeping tags readable; padded, adjustable designs reduce chafing and shifting. Leash attachments and hardware should hold a tag securely without adding weight or noisy rattling, so quick-release strength and solid D-rings are key. Engraving legibility, customizable lines, and protective coatings extend readability and identification effectiveness over time.
