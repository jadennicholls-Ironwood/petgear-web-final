Collars and harnesses should emphasize secure fit, escape resistance, and padding to prevent chafing and distribute pressure evenly. Benefit-first features &mdash; such as tangle-resistant cords, reflective detailing for low-light visibility, and smooth locking mechanisms &mdash; directly improve daily walks. Fit and adjustability matter more than aesthetics: a well-fitted harness reduces pulling and increases comfort for both handler and dog. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to find thoughtfully selected options that keep walks comfortable, controlled, and enjoyable.</p></div></section>
