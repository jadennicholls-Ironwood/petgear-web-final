<p><strong>Reflective gear can increase a dog's nighttime visibility by several yards, helping drivers and cyclists spot pets earlier.</strong> When comparing reflective leashes and harnesses, the priority is how well they improve visibility while keeping the animal comfortable and secure. Focus on reflective material type, placement, and brightness, plus fit, adjustability, and durable stitching that stands up to regular walks. Consider whether illumination is passive (reflective trim) or active (LED elements), since each offers different advantages for distance and battery life. Practical details like quick-release buckles, easy-clean fabrics, and leash attachment points make nighttime use smoother and safer for both handler and dog. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to compare top features and picks before choosing the best kit for regular evening outings.</p>
