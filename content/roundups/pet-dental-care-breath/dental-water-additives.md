Active ingredients like cetylpyridinium chloride, chlorhexidine, or natural enzymes deliver different benefits&mdash;look for the one aligned with your pet's sensitivity and dental needs. Other practical factors include palatability so pets continue drinking, clear dosing instructions, and compatibility with filters or fountains. Talk with your veterinarian before introducing any additive, especially for pets with health conditions or those on medications. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to compare formulations, safety notes, and usage tips.</p></div></section>
