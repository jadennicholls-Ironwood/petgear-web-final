Consider tool size and tip design to match fur type and tick size, and favor shapes that minimize residue and prevent head breakage. Kept in a first aid kit, a reliable tick tool helps turn an anxious moment into a quick, controlled response. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to compare features, cleaning tips, and handling techniques so you can choose the right tool for routine care.</p></div></section>
