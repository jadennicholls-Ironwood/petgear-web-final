<p><strong>Nearly one in three pet owners seek mobility solutions to keep senior dogs active and comfortable.</strong> Choosing the right dog stroller or wagon hinges on comfort, safety, and ease of use&mdash;features that directly affect an older pet's mobility and pain levels. Focus on roomy, supportive interiors, easy entry and exit, secure harness attachments, and durable wheels that absorb shocks for smoother rides. Practical details like foldability, weight capacity, doorway clearance, and washable liners matter when daily convenience and hygiene are priorities. A stable frame, reliable brakes, and good maneuverability reduce caregiver strain and help seniors enjoy more outdoor activity. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to compare options and find the best match for a senior dog's mobility and comfort.</p>
