<p><strong>Non-slip traction socks are a simple, high-impact way to help senior and mobility-challenged dogs stay steady on hardwood, tile, and stairs.</strong> When comparing options, prioritize secure grip and a flexible sole that promotes natural footing while protecting delicate joints. A snug, adjustable fit prevents slipping off and reduces chafing, while breathable fabrics and soft padding keep paws comfortable during longer wear. Look for reinforced seams and washable construction for easier upkeep, plus textured tread patterns that maintain traction without blocking paw movement. Sizing guidance and clear closure systems matter for senior pets that may resist lengthy fitting sessions. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to compare features, fit tips, and top options tailored to mobility needs.</p>
