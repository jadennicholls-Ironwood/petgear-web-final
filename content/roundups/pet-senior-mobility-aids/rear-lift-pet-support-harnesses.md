<p><strong>Rear-lift pet support harnesses are a proven mobility aid that eases joint strain and helps senior or injured pets stay active with dignity.</strong> When comparing options, prioritize ergonomic rear support, even weight distribution, and soft yet durable materials that prevent chafing. Fit and adjustability matter most&mdash;proper sizing and multiple straps deliver secure lift without restricting movement. Easy-on designs, machine-washable fabrics, and padded handles make daily use simpler for caregivers and calmer for pets. Look for reinforced stitching and thoughtful hardware that hold up to repeated use and provide reliable attachment points for leashes or slings.
