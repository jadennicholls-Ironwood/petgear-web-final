Durability and abrasion resistance matter for fetch on sand, rocks, or docks, minimizing replacements and play interruptions. High-contrast colors and reflective accents speed recovery, while textured grips or scent features boost interest and repeat use. Match size and weight to your pet to avoid fatigue or swallowing hazards, and prefer sealed construction to prevent waterlogging. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to quickly pair features with your pet’s play style and the waters you frequent.</p></div></section>
