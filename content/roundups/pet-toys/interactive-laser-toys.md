When comparing models, prioritize safety features, adjustable movement patterns, battery life, and hands-free operation to maximize engaging play sessions. <strong>Choose devices that balance unpredictable motion with built-in safety cutoffs to reduce frustration and prevent overstimulation.</strong> Also consider durability, quiet operation, and easy cleaning so a toy stands up to daily use without disrupting the home. Think about the pet’s size, prey-drive level, and whether remote control or automatic modes better match their temperament.
