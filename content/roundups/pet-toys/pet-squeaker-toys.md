Design choices&mdash;loud, exposed squeakers versus hidden or reinforced units&mdash;affect how quickly a pet engages and whether the toy resists chewing. Matching toy size, texture, and toughness to a pet's chewing habits and energy level maximizes enjoyment and reduces the chance of frustration. Easy-to-clean materials and replaceable parts simplify upkeep and extend usefulness. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to compare top choices and find the squeaker toy that best boosts play and enrichment.</p></div></section>
