Safety and durable construction matter most&mdash;flexible shafts, non-toxic attachments, and secure fastenings reduce choking and breakage risks. Ease of cleaning and availability of replacement parts extend a toy’s useful life and cut down on waste. Motion variety and adjustability keep interest high as a cat’s energy and skill level change.
