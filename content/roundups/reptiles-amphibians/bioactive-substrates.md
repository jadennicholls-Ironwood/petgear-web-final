Focus on how a substrate supports moisture regulation, encourages beneficial microbes, and sustains live plants for more natural habitats. Key comparisons should include particle size, organic content, drainage performance, and pH compatibility with the species being kept. Also weigh maintenance demands and the ease of spot-cleaning to ensure long-term enclosure health.
