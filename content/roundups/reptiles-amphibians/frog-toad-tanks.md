Look for materials and finishes that resist mold and retain moisture without trapping harmful residues. Size and layout matter too: ample floor space and vertical structure influence movement patterns and stress levels. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to match enclosure features with species-specific needs and husbandry goals.</p></div></section>
