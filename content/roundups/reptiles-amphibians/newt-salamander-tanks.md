Look for tanks with both aquatic and terrestrial zones to enable natural behaviors like swimming, foraging, and resting. Easy-maintenance features&mdash;removable inserts, accessible lids, and washable substrates&mdash;reduce stress on animals by simplifying cleaning and water changes. Choose non-toxic materials and well-placed ventilation to balance air exchange without drying the habitat, enhancing long-term wellbeing. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to compare specific options and pick the setup that matches species needs and keeper workflow.</p></div></section>
