Look for kits that include a thermostat-linked heat source, a properly sized enclosure, humidity solutions, and durable hides to support natural behavior. Ease of setup, built-in safety features, and clear care instructions matter for sustainable, low-stress ownership. Modular designs that allow upgrades&mdash;like adding a larger hide or a more precise thermostat&mdash;help protect long-term health and simplify husbandry. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to match a kit to your keeper goals and enclosure needs.</p></div></section>
