Benefit-first considerations include how a kit supports natural behaviors&mdash;climbing, hiding, and thermoregulation&mdash;so the gecko remains active and well-conditioned. Safety features like escape-proof lids, non-toxic substrates, and reliable heating help prevent common problems such as impaction, dehydration, and thermal stress. Practical extras&mdash;built-in hides, realistic foliage, and thoughtful ventilation&mdash;cut setup time and improve husbandry outcomes for new and experienced keepers alike. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to compare key specs and choose a kit that supports healthy, low-stress housing for crested geckos.</p></div></section>
