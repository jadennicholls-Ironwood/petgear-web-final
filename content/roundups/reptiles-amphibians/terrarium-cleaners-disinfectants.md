Consider residue and material compatibility so substrates, hides, and décor aren’t damaged or made unsafe between cleanings. Ease of use, clear dilution and contact-time instructions, and compatibility with quarantine protocols make routine maintenance safer and more reliable. Fragrance and biodegradability can affect animal comfort and environmental impact, but efficacy should remain the top criterion. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to compare options and pick the best fit for a given enclosure.</p></div></section>
