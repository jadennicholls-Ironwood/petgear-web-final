Size and water depth determine activity levels and species compatibility, while proper UVB, heat gradients, and humidity control support growth, shell health, and breeding behavior. Filtration capacity, ease of cleaning, and accessible maintenance access reduce stress for animals and make long-term care manageable. Durability, corrosion-resistant fixtures, and escape-proof design protect investments and maintain animal safety.
