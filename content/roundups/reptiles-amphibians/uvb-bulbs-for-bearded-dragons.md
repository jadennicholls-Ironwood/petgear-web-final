Consider fixture compatibility and distance &mdash; even the best bulb can't help if positioned incorrectly &mdash; and look for even coverage to minimize shadowed zones. Durability, predictable output decline, and compatibility with preferred basking temperatures are practical factors that improve welfare and reduce maintenance hassle. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to compare features and pick a solution that fits enclosure size and husbandry goals.</p></div></section>
