Quality UVB supports vitamin D3 synthesis, calcium metabolism, and natural activity cycles, which directly reduces the risk of metabolic bone issues. Practical factors such as bulb type (fluorescent, compact, or mercury vapor), fixture compatibility, and emitted heat should guide selection so lighting integrates safely with heating and hiding areas. Also consider fixture placement and distance guidelines for accurate UVB dosing, and remember that substrate and enclosure furnishings can affect exposure. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to compare options tested for spectral stability, coverage, and overall benefit to tortoise health.</p></div></section>
