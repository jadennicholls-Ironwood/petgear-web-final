Key performance factors include range and GPS accuracy, battery life and charging convenience, durable waterproof construction, and intuitive mobile controls for alerts and geofencing. Camera specifics like resolution, low-light capability, and two-way audio determine how effectively you can monitor and interact with a pet from afar. For collars, look for adjustable fit, soft contact points, and customizable training modes that emphasize humane correction and clear feedback. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to compare essential specs and pick the combination of tracking, camera, and smart collar features that fit a pet’s lifestyle.</p></div></section>
