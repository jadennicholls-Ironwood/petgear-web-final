Aquapapa Sponge Filters use open-cell sponge media to trap debris while supporting the bacteria that break down ammonia and nitrite. You can expect steadier fish behavior because the soft, even flow removes turbulence that stresses juveniles. Installation is straightforward, the unit fits most small airline tubing and comes with a weighted base so placement is stable. For upkeep you rinse the sponge in tank water during partial water changes and replace the sponge only when it starts to degrade, which keeps biological cycles intact. Compatibility notes: these filters work best with a modest air pump sized for the tank, and pairing two in a 20 to 30 gallon community tank helps distribute flow and filtration. Outcomes include clearer water between cleanings and lower ammonia spikes, so betta fry and shy fish show steadier feeding and activity. <a href=https://amzn.to/4heE8NI rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target=_blank><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p></div><hr><h3 id=faqs>Frequently Asked Questions</h3><p><strong>Will Aquapapa Sponge Filters fit a 10 gallon tank and keep fry safe?</strong></p><p>Yes, they fit a 10 gallon tank and the gentle flow is well suited for fry.
