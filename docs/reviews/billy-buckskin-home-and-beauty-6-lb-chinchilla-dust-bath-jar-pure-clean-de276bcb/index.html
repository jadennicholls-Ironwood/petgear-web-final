The product is a pure pumice sand meant for small pets like hamsters, mice, and degu, and it breaks down oils from fur without wetting or soiling bedding. One clear benefit is steadier behavior during grooming sessions, fewer oil-related matting issues, and less need for spot washing. Another practical outcome is easier setup, you pour a shallow layer into a low dish and place it in a quiet corner; pets typically accept a familiar shallow container faster than enclosed units. Compatibility is broad for small rodents, but very small pups may need a shallower dish to prevent digging hazards. Upkeep is simple, shake out loose debris between uses<p><a class=btn href=https://amzn.to/4opxWEK target=_blank rel="nofollow sponsored noopener">View Here</a></p><p><a href=/roundups/degu-habitat-enrichment/dust-baths-houses/>← Back to Dust Baths & Houses</a></p><aside class=disclosure>This page may include sponsored links.
