DVHEY DVHEY Sponge Filters combine large-pore sponges and ceramic filter media for immediate mechanical trapping, and a steady surface for biological colonization. You can expect calmer fish behavior thanks to bubble-driven, low-shear flow, and noticeably clearer water when sponges are rinsed on a regular schedule. These filters fit most standard airline connectors, and the kit approach makes them portable between tanks for quarantine or breeding setups. Upkeep is straightforward, rinse the sponge in old tank water during water changes to preserve bacteria, and top up ceramic media as needed after heavy soiling. They work well as primary filtration in low-bio-load systems, or as auxiliary biological filters alongside a canister or hang-on-back unit. Quiet-running design and modular parts mean minimal fiddling once installed, and replacement sponges are easy to source if you want backup spares. <a href=https://amzn.to/495BW92 rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target=_blank><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p></div><hr><h3 id=faqs>Frequently Asked Questions</h3><p><strong>Are DVHEY Sponge Filters suitable for fry and shrimp tanks?</strong></p><p>Yes, DVHEY Sponge Filters provide gentle, low-shear flow that protects delicate fry and baby shrimp. The sponge surface traps debris while offering a safe grazing area for microfauna. Keep the flow modest and perform gentle rinses so young stock are not stressed.</p><p><strong>How do I set up a DVHEY Sponge Filter in my aquarium?</strong></p><p>Setup is simple, connect the base to standard airline tubing and an air pump, then position the sponge vertically in the tank corner. Adjust air volume to change flow, and ensure the sponge sits fully submerged for proper suction. Use an in-tank check valve if you want to prevent backflow during maintenance.</p><p><strong>What is the recommended cleaning routine for these sponge filters?</strong></p><p>Rinse the sponge in a bucket of tank water during a regular water change, gently squeezing until the water runs clearer. Avoid tap water unless you plan to recolonize beneficial bacteria, and stagger cleaning if you use multiple sponges. Replace sponge or ceramic media only when wear reduces effectiveness.</p><p><strong>Will DVHEY Sponge Filters harm shrimp or small fish?</strong></p><p>No, the low flow and soft surface are safe for shrimp and small fish when adjusted properly. Fine mesh sponges prevent tiny fry from being sucked into the intake, and the gentle bubble lift reduces turbulence. Monitor young animals after installation to confirm comfort.</p><p><strong>How long do the sponge and ceramic media last with normal use?</strong></p><p>Sponge life depends on handling and water chemistry, many users get months to years from a single sponge with routine care. Ceramic media rarely needs replacing, it mainly provides surface area for bacteria and will last a long time unless physically broken. Keep spare sponges on hand for quick swaps during deep cleans.</p><p><a class=btn href=https://amzn.to/495BW92 target=_blank rel="nofollow sponsored noopener">View Here</a></p><p><a href=/roundups/axolotl-habitat-care/sponge-filters/>← Back to Sponge Filters</a></p><aside class=disclosure>This page may include sponsored links.
