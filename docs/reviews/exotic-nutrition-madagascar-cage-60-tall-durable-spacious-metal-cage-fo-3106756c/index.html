The cage emphasizes climbable space, with shelves and platforms that let animals express natural behaviors, which can lead to steadier activity and less boredom. Bar spacing and door latches are sized to reduce slips and escapes, so day-to-day supervision is less demanding. Assembly is mostly plug-and-play, with clear clips and fasteners that cut setup time, and the removable bottom tray and grate allow quick spot cleaning and deeper washes. The metal finish wipes clean and resists staining, so bedding changes are faster and odor control is easier. Fit notes: measure doorway clearances and ceiling heights before buying, and consider adding soft ledges or hammocks for extra comfort. For larger pairs or groups, plan additional shelving to increase usable area without expanding the cage footprint. <a href=https://amzn.to/4qkIDKQ rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target=_blank><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p></div><hr><h3 id=faqs>Frequently Asked Questions</h3><p><strong>Is Exotic Nutrition Tall Cages (Glider-Safe Spacing) safe for sugar gliders and similar small pets?</strong></p><p>Yes. The bar spacing is sized to keep small gliders from squeezing through while allowing climbing and view lines. Latches are designed to stay closed during active play, and the metal structure resists chewing and deformation under normal use. Add soft fabrics and sheltered nesting areas for comfort and extra safety.</p><p><strong>How hard is assembly and what tools are needed?</strong></p><p>Assembly is straightforward and mostly requires hand-tightening bolts and clipping platforms into place. Basic tools like a screwdriver or wrench may help but are often included or unnecessary. Expect about 20 to 40 minutes for a single person to finish, depending on how many accessories you add.</p><p><strong>What is the best way to clean the cage and control odors?</strong></p><p>Use the removable tray for daily spot cleaning and swap bedding weekly for odor control. Wipe bars and shelves with a mild pet-safe cleaner and rinse thoroughly when doing deeper cleans. Metal parts tolerate scrubbing, so occasional full washes keep the cage looking and smelling fresh.</p><p><strong>Will this cage fit through standard doorways and into small rooms?</strong></p><p>Measure the assembled height and width against door frame clearances before purchase, as the tall design can be awkward in tight spaces. The cage can sometimes be assembled in place if doorway heights are limited. Consider disassembling the top for transport and reattaching once inside.</p><p><strong>How long can I expect the cage to last with regular use?</strong></p><p>The metal build and simple fasteners yield many years of service when cleaned and maintained. Regular checks of latches, shelf clips, and any coated finishes prolong life. Replace worn accessories like hammocks or wooden perches as needed to keep the habitat safe and comfortable.</p><p><a class=btn href=https://amzn.to/4qkIDKQ target=_blank rel="nofollow sponsored noopener">View Here</a></p><p><a href=/roundups/sugar-glider-habitat-enrichment/tall-cages-glider-safe-spacing-/>← Back to Tall Cages (Glider-Safe Spacing)</a></p><aside class=disclosure>This page may include sponsored links.
