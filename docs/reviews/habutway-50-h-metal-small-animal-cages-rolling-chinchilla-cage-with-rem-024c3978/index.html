HABUTWAY HABUTWAY Multi-Level Metal Cages include removable trays, modular platforms, and clip-on ramps so you can arrange levels to match the animal's mobility and to create secure feeding and sleeping zones. Users can expect steadier behavior from pets given clear climbing routes and separated zones for play and rest, which reduces stress-related pacing and chewing. The cage fits through standard doorways with casters engaged, and the locking wheels keep it stable once in place. Wire spacing and platform sizes suit chinchillas, rats, ferrets, and similar small mammals, but check measurements against your pet's size before buying. Setup is a two-person task if you want to speed assembly, though the panels bolt together with basic tools. Cleaning is straightforward because the pans lift out and the wire grid detaches for a quick rinse. Regular spot cleaning and weekly pan scrubs will keep odors down and extend the cage's usable life. <a href=https://amzn.to/4qipDMR rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target=_blank><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p></div><hr><h3 id=faqs>Frequently Asked Questions</h3><p><strong>Will HABUTWAY Multi-Level Metal Cages fit in a narrow hallway or doorway?</strong></p><p>Measure the cage footprint and the tightest doorway or hallway before moving it in.
