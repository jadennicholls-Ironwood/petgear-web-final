The cage’s tight 1/2-inch wire spacing prevents escapes for very small species while the four-level interior creates separate zones for sleeping, eating, and playing. Users will notice cleaner surfaces from the pull-out tray, which reduces time spent scrubbing corners, and steadier daily routines because pets can move through levels without being lifted. Assembly is straightforward, with a handful of bolts and pre-drilled panels, so setup friction is low even for first-time builders. The removable rolling stand adds portability, so you can change light and temperature exposure without fully disassembling the unit. For upkeep, wipe the bars weekly with a mild pet-safe cleaner and remove the tray for a quick rinse. The metal finish resists chewing and holds up to routine cleaning, which helps the cage look and perform well over years of use. <a href=https://amzn.to/4onnRIt rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target=_blank><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p></div><hr><h3 id=faqs>Frequently Asked Questions</h3><p><strong>Will Mcage Tall Cages (Glider-Safe Spacing) fit two sugar gliders comfortably?</strong></p><p>Yes, the vertical layout and multiple platforms give two sugar gliders room to glide and nest separately.
