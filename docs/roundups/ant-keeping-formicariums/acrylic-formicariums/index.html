Ventilation and humidity control directly affect colony health, so select designs with adjustable airflow and moisture management to suit different species. Escape-prevention features like secure lids and reliable seals protect both ants and handlers, while modular systems allow expansion as colonies develop. Practical details such as easy-to-clean surfaces, compatible substrate access, and built-in feeding ports reduce routine maintenance and streamline care.
