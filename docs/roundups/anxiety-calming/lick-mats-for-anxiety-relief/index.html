Practical factors include non-slip backing to prevent skidding, varied groove patterns to extend engagement, and materials that resist stains for easy cleaning. Durability and safe, BPA-free compounds support long-term use and lower the risk of breakdown that can trigger stress. Size and shape matter: choose a mat that fits feeding areas and matches licking style so sessions stay comfortable and calming.
