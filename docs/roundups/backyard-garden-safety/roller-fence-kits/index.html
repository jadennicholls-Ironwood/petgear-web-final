Smooth-rolling mechanisms and secure latching keep gates dependable while reducing pinch points and trip hazards. Material choice&mdash;galvanized steel, aluminum, or treated timber&mdash;affects longevity and the level of maintenance required. Also consider customizability, warranty terms, and whether the kit includes posts, hinges, and clear assembly instructions for a faster setup.
