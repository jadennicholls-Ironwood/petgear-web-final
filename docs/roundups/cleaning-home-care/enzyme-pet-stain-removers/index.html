Choosing the right formula matters for odor elimination, fabric safety, and recurrence prevention. <strong>Strong enzymes target stain sources instead of just masking odors, so treated areas can stay cleaner and fresher longer.</strong> Look for products labeled for specific surfaces&mdash;carpet, upholstery, hardwood, or outdoor fabrics&mdash;to avoid discoloration and residue. Fragrance-free or low-scent options help neutralize odors without triggering sensitivities in pets or people. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to compare active ingredients, application methods, and cleaning benefits that matter most in daily home care.</p></div></section><h2>Buyer’s Guide</h2><h3>Rocco & Roxie Supply Co Rocco & Roxie Supply Co.
