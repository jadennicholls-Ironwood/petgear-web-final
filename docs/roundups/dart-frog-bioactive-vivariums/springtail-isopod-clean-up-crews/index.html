Look for hardy springtails and isopods that tolerate high humidity, low disturbance, and coexist with frogs without becoming a visible nuisance. For dart frogs, crews that enhance nutrient cycling, keep leaf litter clear, and minimize pathogen growth deliver the biggest practical benefits with minimal intervention. Practical factors such as ease of sourcing, enclosure size, and starter colony size affect setup and long-term balance. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below for concise buying considerations and setup tips to choose the right clean-up crew for a thriving vivarium.</p><h2>Buyer’s Guide</h2><h3>TC INSECTS Dwarf White Isopods , Bioactive Clean Up Crew Frog Reptile…</h3><p>TC INSECTS Dwarf White Isopods , Bioactive Clean Up Crew Frog Reptile… in Springtail/Isopod Clean-up Crews aims to deliver balanced day-to-day performance.
