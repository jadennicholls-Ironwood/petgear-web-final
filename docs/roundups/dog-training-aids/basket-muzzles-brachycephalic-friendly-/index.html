Material choice and construction affect durability and hygiene&mdash;look for chew-resistant fabrics and components that are easy to clean. Adjustable straps, clear sizing guidance and soft contact points reduce chafing and help maintain a secure, comfortable fit that encourages cooperative behavior. Practical features such as padded nose bridges, quick-release buckles and corrosion-resistant hardware make daily use simpler for handlers and calmer for dogs.
