Material and construction determine durability and safety; dense fleece pockets and reinforced backing help prevent shredding and accidental ingestion. Cleaning and maintenance matter for hygiene&mdash;machine-washable designs and quick-dry fabrics keep sessions safe and easy to refresh. Consider size and pocket density to match treat sizes and to scale difficulty, plus non-slip bases for secure indoor use and portability for fieldwork.
