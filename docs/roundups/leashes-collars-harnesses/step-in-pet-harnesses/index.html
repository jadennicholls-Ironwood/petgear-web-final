Look for a secure fit and adjustable straps that prevent chafing while allowing natural movement, plus breathable, easy-to-clean fabrics for active dogs. Durable hardware like welded D-rings and robust buckles keeps attachments reliable, and multiple leash-attachment points can provide extra control without sacrificing comfort. Visibility features, padding, and compatibility with training tools are worth considering depending on nighttime walks and behavior needs.
