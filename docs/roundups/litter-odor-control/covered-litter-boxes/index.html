Consider entry height, ventilation, and how well a design prevents litter tracking when comparing options&mdash;these factors directly improve daily hygiene and reduce odors. Behavioral fit is equally important: shy cats prefer enclosed spaces, while large or senior cats need generous clearances and low thresholds.
