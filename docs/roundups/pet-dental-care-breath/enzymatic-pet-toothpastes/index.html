Texture and flavor matter for acceptance&mdash;gels and pastes designed for easy application or no-brush use increase compliance and reduce stress during dental care. Safety and ingredient transparency are crucial; look for products labeled specifically for pets, hypoallergenic options if needed, and clear veterinary guidance. Packaging convenience and dosing controls can make daily routines simpler, and pairing toothpaste with regular at-home brushing or dental chews enhances long-term results.
