Safety matters: non-toxic materials, secure closures, and rounded edges prevent chewing hazards and accidental ingestion. Long-term engagement hinges on adjustable difficulty, robust construction, and a design suited to a pet's size and play style. Consider maintenance factors like ease of cleaning, refill simplicity, and noise level to keep daily routines smooth.
