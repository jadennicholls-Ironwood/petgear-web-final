Prioritize soft, breathable materials and a precise fit that prevents licking and rubbing without restricting movement. Design elements like full coverage for incision sites, access panels for dressing changes, and openings for toileting improve practicality and reduce caregiver strain. Ease of putting on, secure closures, and machine-washable fabrics matter for frequent cleaning and stress-free handling.
