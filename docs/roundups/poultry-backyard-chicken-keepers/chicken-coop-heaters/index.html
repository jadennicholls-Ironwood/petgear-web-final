Energy efficiency matters for operating costs and for maintaining steady temperatures without dramatic fluctuations. Durability, weather resistance, and ease of cleaning help keep maintenance simple for poultry and backyard chicken keepers. Size and heat output should match coop dimensions and ventilation to avoid drafts and overheating, while easy installation means quicker, safer setup.
