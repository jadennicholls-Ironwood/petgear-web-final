Durable frames and panels that clean easily help maintain stable humidity and hygiene critical for successful breeding. Convenient access panels for safe feeding and egg-case handling reduce disturbance to adults and nymphs. Clear visibility and compatibility with supplemental lighting let keepers monitor development and support egg incubation.
