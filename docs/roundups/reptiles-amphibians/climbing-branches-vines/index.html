Consider weight-bearing capacity for larger lizards or snakes, resistance to moisture and mold for humid setups, and naturalistic shapes that promote hiding and exploration. Synthetic vines can offer consistent performance, while real wood provides authentic texture and microhabitats; the right choice depends on species needs and enclosure conditions.
