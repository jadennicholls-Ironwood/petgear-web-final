Look for spacing that prevents escapes and injuries while still allowing airflow and sightlines, plus ample height for launching, leaping, and layered hammocks. Material quality, ease of cleaning, and flexible attachment points for branches, pouches, and wheels affect daily care and long-term enrichment. Accessibility for handling and maintenance keeps interaction positive and reduces stress for both keeper and pet.
