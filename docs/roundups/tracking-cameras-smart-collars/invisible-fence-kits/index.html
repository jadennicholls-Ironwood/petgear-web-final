Key specs that affect daily use include signal range and consistency, battery life and charging convenience, camera resolution and night vision, two-way audio, plus intuitive mobile controls for alerts and history. Also weigh collar fit and comfort, waterproofing and build quality, and the vendor's support and update cadence for app and firmware security. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to compare feature sets, integration options, and installation styles so you can choose a system that fits your pet's needs.</p></div></section><h2>Buyer’s Guide</h2><h3>PetSafe Wireless Pet Containment System</h3><p>PetSafe Wireless Pet Containment System in Invisible Fence Kits aims to deliver balanced day-to-day performance.
