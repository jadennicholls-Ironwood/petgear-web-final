Consider ergonomics and attachment systems that keep treats secure but reachable, plus materials that are easy to clean after park or trail sessions. Additional features&mdash;like adjustable straps, multiple compartments, scent-resistant linings, or included clickers&mdash;can streamline training flow and reduce distractions.
