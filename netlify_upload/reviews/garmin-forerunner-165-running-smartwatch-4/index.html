The watch quickly syncs with the Garmin Connect app, providing personalized training plans. During a 5K, the real-time pace and heart rate metrics help maintain optimal performance.

The watch's durability is a strength, handling rough terrain without issue. However, in dense forest areas, GPS signals might occasionally falter.

Setting up these notifications is intuitive, but managing them during high-intensity workouts can be distracting. The watch’s ability to control music playback without reaching for your phone is a significant benefit.</p><h2>Key Considerations</h2><ul><li>The accuracy of training metrics for serious athletes.</li><li>The visual appeal and readability of the AMOLED display in various lighting conditions.</li><li>The smartwatch's battery life relative to its features.</li><li>The integration capabilities with third-party fitness apps and devices.</li></ul><h2>Final Verdict</h2><p>The Garmin Forerunner 165 is ideal for runners and fitness enthusiasts seeking a balance between functionality and style.
