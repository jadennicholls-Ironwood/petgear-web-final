One caveat is the need for a compatible graphics card to fully utilize Adaptive Sync, which may require an additional investment.</p><h3>Use Case 3</h3><p>For a gaming setup in a shared living space, the monitor's tilt adjustment allows for flexible positioning to suit different seating arrangements. The HDR10 support enhances the visual experience for both games and streaming content, making it a versatile choice for entertainment.
