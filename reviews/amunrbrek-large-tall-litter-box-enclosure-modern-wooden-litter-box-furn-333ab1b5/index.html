Expect a roomy interior that accepts many XL trays and gives cats room to enter and turn comfortably, while the front and side panels lift for hassle-free access. The open shelf holds supplies within reach, which speeds daily maintenance. Materials are finished to resist moisture, so wiping with a damp cloth keeps surfaces clean, and occasional deep clean involves removing the tray and airing the interior. For placement, choose a stable, level area away from heavy foot traffic to help shy cats use the box more reliably. <a href=https://amzn.to/4hgmwRF rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target=_blank><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p></div><hr><h3 id=faqs>Frequently Asked Questions</h3><p><strong>Will the amunrbrek Litter Box Furniture Enclosures fit my extra-large tray?</strong></p><p>Measure the external dimensions of your tray and compare them to the cabinet interior, since the enclosure is built for XL trays but sizes vary. Allow a couple inches on each side for easy placement and to avoid pressing the tray against the walls which makes removal harder. If you plan to use a covered tray check the height clearance as well.</p><p><strong>How hard is assembly and what tools are needed?</strong></p><p>Assembly is moderate, most people complete it in under an hour with basic tools like a screwdriver or power driver on low torque. Parts are labeled and panels slot together, but having a second person helps align panels and speed the process. Keep the instructions and small hardware in a safe place for future tightening.</p><p><strong>What is the best way to clean and maintain the cabinet?</strong></p><p>Wipe surfaces regularly with a damp cloth and mild detergent to remove dust and light stains, then dry thoroughly to protect the finish. For deep cleaning, remove the tray and any liners, air out the interior for a while, and vacuum loose litter before wiping again. Avoid harsh chemical cleaners that could damage the finish or leave strong odors.</p><p><strong>Are there safety tips for using this furniture around curious pets?</strong></p><p>Place the enclosure on a level surface to prevent tipping and keep heavier items off the top if pets jump on it frequently,<p><a class=btn href=https://amzn.to/4hgmwRF target=_blank rel="nofollow sponsored noopener">View Here</a></p><p><a href=/roundups/litter-odor-control/litter-box-furniture-enclosures/>← Back to Litter Box Furniture Enclosures</a></p><aside class=disclosure>This page may include sponsored links.
