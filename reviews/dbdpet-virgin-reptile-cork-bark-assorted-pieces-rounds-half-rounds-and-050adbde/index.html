DBDPet DBDPet Scorpion Hides, Cork Bark & Burrow Tubes stands out for mix-and-match pieces that allow fast staging of hides, basking ledges, and plant mounts, so you can create microclimates and sightlines that steady animal behavior. Expect quicker setups, because rounds and flats tuck into corners or stack to make deeper retreats without glued supports. The material is naturally insulating and breathable, which helps maintain humidity gradients when paired with moss or substrate pockets. For compatibility, measure the largest round before ordering if you keep very small frogs or hatchlings, and trim with a serrated saw to fit tight spaces. Cleaning is straightforward, a dry brush or brief freshwater rinse followed by air drying keeps pieces hygienic. Over time cork develops more pronounced grooves that animals use for grip and concealment, so you gain functionality as the decor weathers. <a href=https://amzn.to/47wOqVW rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target=_blank><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p></div><hr><h3 id=faqs>Frequently Asked Questions</h3><p><strong>Are DBDPet Scorpion Hides, Cork Bark & Burrow Tubes safe for tropical amphibians?</strong></p><p>Yes, cork bark is nontoxic and commonly used with tropical species, but it is porous so it will absorb moisture.
