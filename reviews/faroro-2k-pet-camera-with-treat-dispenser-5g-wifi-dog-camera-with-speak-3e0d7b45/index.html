The unit pairs quickly with modern routers and the companion app, so setup is usually a matter of minutes. Two clear outcomes you can expect are steadier behavior during alone time and fewer startle reactions, thanks to on-demand voice and treat cues. The camera provides live streaming and night vision for reliable monitoring, while the treat mechanism supports short, measured rewards that help with training. Fit is best for homes with counter space or low shelves, and the power cord means it is portable within a room but not battery-free. For upkeep, the treat hopper is removable for quick rinsing and the exterior wipes clean with a damp cloth. Regular checks for stale treats and a light dusting of the lens will keep video quality and dispensing consistent. <a href=https://amzn.to/47bKDMH rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target=_blank><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p></div><hr><h3 id=faqs>Frequently Asked Questions</h3><p><strong>Is the faroro Pet Camera Treat Dispensers easy to set up with my home WiFi?</strong></p><p>Yes, the camera uses a standard phone app workflow and supports 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks on most routers.
