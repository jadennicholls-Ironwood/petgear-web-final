Halitaa Litter Box Furniture Enclosures uses a single-entry design and a top-mounted scratch pad that doubles as a landing mat, which helps reduce litter tracked outside the box and gives cats a familiar surface to scratch. The cabinet-style build hides odors and litter sights, and the interior fits most standard and covered boxes if you confirm dimensions first. Expect easier daily scooping when the top or side access panel is removed, and expect simple upkeep since the panels wipe clean and the scratch pad is replaceable. Portability is reasonable for one person, with lightweight panels that unbolt for moving or storage. For households wanting a multiuse furniture piece that steadies pet behavior and keeps cleanup manageable, this model aims to deliver a tidy, dependable solution. <a href=https://amzn.to/3W8mrFK rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target=_blank><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p></div><hr><h3 id=faqs>Frequently Asked Questions</h3><p><strong>Will Halitaa Litter Box Furniture Enclosures fit my existing litter box?</strong></p><p>Measure your box before buying to be sure.
