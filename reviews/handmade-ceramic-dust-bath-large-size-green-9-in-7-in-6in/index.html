Handmade Dust Baths & Houses are offered in a green glaze and multiple sizes, so you can pick a bowl that fits a coop, run, or indoor corner. The deep, rounded interior helps animals turn and toss dust, which removes excess oils and discourages mites, while the ceramic walls stay cool and steady underfoot. Expect easier daily maintenance, you will tip and shake or hose the bowl, then let it dry in sun. For shared use, the roomy footprint reduces crowding and keeps behavior calmer during peak activity. The weight and finish also make the bowl resistant to being nudged by larger birds, and the smooth glaze cuts down on trapped debris so cleaning takes minutes rather than a long scrub. This product suits owners who want a reliable, low-fuss dusting station that lasts through seasons, and it works well in both outdoor coops and sheltered indoor spaces. <a href=https://amzn.to/48x8zwc rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target=_blank><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p></div><hr><h3 id=faqs>Frequently Asked Questions</h3><p><strong>What size should I choose for a mixed flock or multiple small birds?</strong></p><p>Choose a size based on the largest bird you keep and how many will bathe together.

Measure your coop or run floor space to ensure the bowl sits flat without blocking pathways or nesting areas.</p><p><strong>How do I clean and maintain the ceramic dust bath?</strong></p><p>Empty old dust and debris regularly, then hose or wipe the inside with soapy water if needed. Rinse thoroughly and allow the bowl to air dry in sunlight to prevent moisture buildup. Replace the dust medium when it becomes clumped or discolored to keep bathing effective.</p><p><strong>Is ceramic safe for chicks and small animals to use?</strong></p><p>Ceramic is generally safe when the glaze is intact and free of sharp chips. Monitor young animals for excessive pecking at damaged edges and replace the bowl if cracks appear. Place the bowl on a level surface to avoid tipping and provide supervised access for very small chicks.</p><p><strong>Can I use this in an outdoor coop year-round?</strong></p><p>Yes, but bring the bowl under cover or inside during<p><a class=btn href=https://amzn.to/48x8zwc target=_blank rel="nofollow sponsored noopener">View Here</a></p><p><a href=/roundups/degu-habitat-enrichment/dust-baths-houses/>← Back to Dust Baths & Houses</a></p><aside class=disclosure>This page may include sponsored links.
