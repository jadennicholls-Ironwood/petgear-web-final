IRIS USA, Inc. Top Entry Litter Boxes are built to simplify daily litter care and to give cats a contained, private place to go. IRIS USA, Inc. Top Entry Litter Boxes feature a high-sided base and a perforated top rim that catches loose litter as cats exit, which lowers mess on floors and bedding and reduces vacuuming frequency. The hard plastic construction wipes clean with a damp cloth and accepts most clumping litters, so performance stays consistent with minimal effort. A removable lid and a molded scoop clip keep tools handy and cut setup friction when you replace litter or deep-clean the pan. For households with curious dogs or toddlers, the top entry blocks access and keeps unsupervised disturbances to a minimum, which can help keep cats using the box regularly. The box fits in closets or corners and moves easily if you need to change locations, and it also pairs with low-profile mats for extra litter control. <a href=https://amzn.to/47bBMus rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target=_blank><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p></div><hr><h3 id=faqs>Frequently Asked Questions</h3><p><strong>Will IRIS USA, Inc.
