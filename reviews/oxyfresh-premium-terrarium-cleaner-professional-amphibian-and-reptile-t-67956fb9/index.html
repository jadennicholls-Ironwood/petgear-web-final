Expect clearer glass and faster spot-clean cycles, which can reduce stress for animals that react to prolonged disturbance. It is suitable for glass and many hard plastics, and it helps break down waste so wiping is easier and faster. For upkeep mix short, consistent sessions into your routine, wipe surfaces dry after treatment, and save deeper scrubs for scheduled maintenance.
