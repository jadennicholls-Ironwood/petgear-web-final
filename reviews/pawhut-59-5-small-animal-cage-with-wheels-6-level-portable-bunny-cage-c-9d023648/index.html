PawHut Multi-Level Metal Cages stands out for its stackable platforms and a full-width removable tray, which together cut down the time you spend scooping and allow quick visual health checks. Expect steadier behavior from pets that can hop between levels, since they can retreat or explore without crowding a single shelf. The metal grid and secure latches make the cage durable and simple to wipe down with a damp cloth or pet-safe cleaner. Wheels help you move the unit for sun patches or cleaning, and the panels unbolt for compact storage or transport. Keep bedding on the platforms to reduce dust on the tray and check ramps for wear regularly to maintain safe footing. <a href=https://amzn.to/47tg06y rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target=_blank><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p></div><hr><h3 id=faqs>Frequently Asked Questions</h3><p><strong>What size animals work best in PawHut Multi-Level Metal Cages and how much space do they need?</strong></p><p>The cage is sized for small animals such as dwarf rabbits, chinchillas, ferrets, and guinea pigs that benefit from vertical space. Measure your pet and allow room to hop between platforms and lie stretched out; larger breeds may need a wider floor plan or a single-level setup to meet activity needs.</p><p><strong>How difficult is assembly and what tools are required for setup?</strong></p><p>Assembly is straightforward but can take 30 to 60 minutes depending on experience, and having a second person speeds alignment of panels. Basic tools like a screwdriver and adjustable wrench are typically all you need, and the manual shows panel order and latch placement to reduce setup friction.</p><p><strong>What is the best way to clean the removable tray and metal bars?</strong></p><p>Pull the tray out for daily spot cleaning and use a mild pet-safe detergent for weekly washing, then air dry before reassembly to prevent rust. Wipe the metal bars with a damp cloth and mild cleaner, avoiding harsh abrasives, and inspect joints for buildup to keep latches operating smoothly.</p><p><strong>Are there safety concerns with ramps and platforms in the cage?</strong></p><p>Check that ramps have textured surfaces or add non-slip covering to prevent slips, especially for young or senior pets. Ensure platforms are securely fastened and latches are closed, and remove any frayed bedding or edges that could trap claws; regular inspections reduce the risk of injury.</p><p><strong>Can the cage be moved through doorways and is it easy to transport?</strong></p
