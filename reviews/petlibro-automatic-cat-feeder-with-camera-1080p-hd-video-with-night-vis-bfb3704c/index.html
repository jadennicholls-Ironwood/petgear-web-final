For homes with multiple small cats or a single medium dog, the feeder keeps portions predictable, which helps maintain weight and routine. The build favors portability, so it can move between rooms or travel kennels without heavy disassembly. Routine upkeep is basic, a quick rinse of the tray and an occasional wipe of the camera lens keeps performance steady.
