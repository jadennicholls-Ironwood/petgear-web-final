SunGrow SunGrow Leaf Litter & Forest Floor Mix blends leaf fragments, small bark pieces, and humus-like material so it mimics the forest floor and supports microfauna, which benefits plant health and animal enrichment. Users can expect steadier hiding and foraging behavior, because scent and texture cues are familiar, and improved humidity buffering that reduces the need for constant misting. The mix is compatible with planted setups, egg-laying areas, and shallow drainage layers, but it is not meant for submerged aquariums. For upkeep, remove visible waste routinely, top up the surface layer to refresh looks, and replace the substrate in sections when decomposition accelerates. It also pairs well with springtails and isopods to speed organic breakdown and keep the surface tidy. For those aiming for a natural aesthetic with straightforward maintenance, this blend balances realism and practical care. <a href=https://amzn.to/4hoDtta rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target=_blank><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p></div><hr><h3 id=faqs>Frequently Asked Questions</h3><p><strong>Is SunGrow Leaf Litter & Forest Floor Mix safe for dart frogs and other small amphibians?</strong></p><p>This mix uses natural leaf and bark components that are generally safe for dart frogs and small amphibians when properly prepared.
