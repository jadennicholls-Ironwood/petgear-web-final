TC INSECTS Springtail/Isopod Clean-up Crews stand out because they are pre-selected for hardy, active individuals that disperse fast and begin processing waste within days, which helps reduce visible mold and trapped organic matter. Expect steadier behavior from ground-dwelling amphibians and invertebrates when substrate stays cleaner, and enjoy simpler setup because the crew tolerates common bioactive substrates and standard humidity levels. Fit notes: these crews suit nano to medium enclosures, and they layer best in at least a couple inches of substrate with some leaf litter. Upkeep is straightforward, water via light misting rather than heavy soaking, add small bits of food like leaf litter or potato slices as needed, and avoid introducing pesticide sprays or strong cleaners that can wipe out the population. For repeated use, top up numbers seasonally or after maintenance events to keep the cleanup function consistent. <a href=https://amzn.to/3J111aL rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target=_blank><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p></div><hr><h3 id=faqs>Frequently Asked Questions</h3><p><strong>Are TC INSECTS Springtail/Isopod Clean-up Crews compatible with small frog or gecko enclosures?</strong></p><p>Yes, these crews are designed for small amphibian and reptile terrariums when used in appropriate numbers. Place them in moist areas with leaf litter and avoid direct contact with live food or freshwater bowls that can wash them out. They help keep substrate cleaner and reduce mold, which benefits ground-dwelling species.</p><p><strong>How do I introduce the crew to a new bioactive setup?</strong></p><p>Acclimate them by opening the shipment at room temperature and placing them into a moist section of substrate. Add some leaf litter and a small food source for initial establishment. Keep humidity stable for the first week and avoid major substrate disturbance so they can spread and begin processing detritus.</p><p><strong>What regular maintenance do these springtails and isopods require?</strong></p><p>Maintenance is minimal, focus on light misting to maintain humidity and occasional additions of organic matter or vegetable slices as food. Check populations periodically and top up if numbers drop after heavy cleaning or a humidity failure. Avoid pesticides and harsh cleaners that can eliminate the crew.</p><p><strong>Are there safety concerns when mixing these clean-up crews with other terrarium<p><a class=btn href=https://amzn.to/3J111aL target=_blank rel="nofollow sponsored noopener">View Here</a></p><p><a href=/roundups/dart-frog-bioactive-vivariums/springtail-isopod-clean-up-crews/>← Back to Springtail/Isopod Clean-up Crews</a></p><aside class=disclosure>This page may include sponsored links.
