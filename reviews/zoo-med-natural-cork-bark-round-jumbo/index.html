These pieces of cork offer textured surfaces for climbing and hiding, and they promote steadier behavior by giving animals a dependable refuge. Zoo Med Scorpion Hides, Cork Bark & Burrow Tubes work well under flat rock, behind bark sheets, or partly buried at the substrate edge to create a semi-subterranean den. For compatibility, choose a jumbo size for larger scorpions or small mammals, and trim the lip slightly if you need a lower entrance. Maintenance is simple, use a stiff brush to remove detritus and let the piece air dry if it becomes damp. Expect less daily disturbance during feeding and handling, since animals will retreat instead of pacing. These hides also lower cleaning friction, because they are easy to lift and inspect without dismantling the rest of the habitat. <a href=https://amzn.to/47fI4ZV rel="nofollow sponsored noopener" target=_blank><strong>Buy on Amazon</strong></a></p></div><hr><h3 id=faqs>Frequently Asked Questions</h3><p><strong>Will Zoo Med Scorpion Hides, Cork Bark & Burrow Tubes fit small desktop terrariums?</strong></p><p>Measure the internal floor space before buying, since jumbo cork pieces are roomy and may crowd tiny tanks. In many small enclosures the edge can be trimmed with a sharp tool to shorten depth. Trimming also lets you lower the entry for easy access while preserving the overall hide shape.</p><p><strong>How do I secure a cork hide so it does not topple in the habitat?</strong></p><p>Place the cork against a stable background or wedge it into substrate so it sits flush with the tank floor. Heavy pieces rarely move, but you can tuck small flat stones behind the back for extra support. Avoid adhesives that could introduce fumes or harm sensitive animals.</p><p><strong>How should I clean and maintain these cork hides?</strong></p><p>Routine care is minimal, brush away loose substrate and feces, then spot rinse with warm water if needed, and let air dry fully. For deeper cleaning, soak in a mild dilute bleach solution, rinse thoroughly, and dry completely before<p><a class=btn href=https://amzn.to/47fI4ZV target=_blank rel="nofollow sponsored noopener">View Here</a></p><p><a href=/roundups/emperor-scorpion-desert-inverts/scorpion-hides-cork-bark-burrow-tubes/>← Back to Scorpion Hides, Cork Bark & Burrow Tubes</a></p><aside class=disclosure>This page may include sponsored links.
