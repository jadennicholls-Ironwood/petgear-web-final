Practical benefits like clear observation windows, durable glass or BPA-free plastic, and easy refill options make day-to-day care and monitoring less stressful. Consider whether included accessories - sterile cotton plugs, pre-filled water chambers, or feeding adapters - save setup time and reduce contamination risk.
