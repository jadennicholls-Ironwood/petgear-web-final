When comparing tanks and systems, prioritize <strong>stable water chemistry, gentle filtration, soft substrate, and enough floor space so axolotls can move and forage comfortably</strong>. Space and materials matter: wider tanks let axolotls roam, glass or acrylic affects insulation and visibility, and secure lids reduce stress and evaporation. Choose equipment that makes routine maintenance straightforward - easier cleaning and reliable filtration reduce health risks and save time. Extras like quiet filters, dimmable lighting, hiding spots, and compatible decor boost welfare and simplify upkeep.
