Look for features that make maintenance simple - removable trays, smooth finishes, and reliable latches reduce stress for both pet and caregiver. Enrichment matters: integrated ramps, multi-tier platforms, hiding spots, and wheel compatibility promote exercise and dental wear. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below for focused guidance on selecting cages and accessories that enhance habitat safety and long-term enrichment.</p><h2>Buyer’s Guide</h2><h3>PawHut 59.5" Small Animal Cage with Wheels, 6-Level Portable Bunny…</h3><p>PawHut 59.5" Small Animal Cage with Wheels, 6-Level Portable Bunny… in Multi-Level Metal Cages aims to deliver balanced day-to-day performance.
