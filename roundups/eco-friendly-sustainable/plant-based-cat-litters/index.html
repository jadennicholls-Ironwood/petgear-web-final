Key performance factors include absorbency, odor control, low dust, and minimal tracking so litter boxes stay cleaner and indoor air quality improves. Consider clumping ability for easy scooping, compostability or septic safety for end-of-life disposal, and whether natural scents or fragrance-free formulas suit sensitive noses. Packaging choices and transport weight influence the product's overall carbon footprint, while ingredient transparency shows true environmental intent.
