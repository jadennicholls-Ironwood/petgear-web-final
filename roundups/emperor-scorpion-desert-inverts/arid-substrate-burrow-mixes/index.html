Texture and compaction determine whether a scorpion can form long-term burrows, while particle size and drainage control moisture retention without promoting mold. Look for mixes that balance organic humus pockets with inert components to limit bacterial growth and simplify spot-cleaning. Ease of preparation and the ability to adjust hydration for targeted microclimates matter for seasonal husbandry and successful breeding setups. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to compare mixes by performance, composition, and suitability for different desert invert species.</p><h2>Buyer’s Guide</h2><h3>Josh's Frogs Dig-It</h3><p>Josh's Frogs Dig-It in Arid Substrate & Burrow Mixes aims to deliver balanced day-to-day performance.
