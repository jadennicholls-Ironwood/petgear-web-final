Material durability, non-toxic finishes, and realistic shapes matter because they affect longevity and animal comfort. Size and interior space must match species and life stage to reduce stress and encourage natural hiding and burrowing. Ease of cleaning and compatibility with substrate or enclosure setups help maintain hygiene without disturbing specimens.
