Key comparison points include material transparency, adhesion strength, thickness, and how the product handles edges and corners to prevent peeling. <strong>Choose guards that balance strong protection with gentle removability and a near-invisible look for seamless furniture care.</strong> Consider fabric compatibility and breathability for upholstered items, plus scratch resistance for wooden, metal, and glass surfaces.
