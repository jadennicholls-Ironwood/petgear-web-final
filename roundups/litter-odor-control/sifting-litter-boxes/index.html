Design details such as drawer systems, mesh sizes, and anti-tracking features influence how much time you'll spend scooping and how well odors stay trapped. Think about dust control, ease of dismantling for deep cleaning, and whether added features like carbon filters or sealed compartments suit multi-cat households.
