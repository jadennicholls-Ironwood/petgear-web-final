Focus on reflective material type, placement, and brightness, plus fit, adjustability, and durable stitching that stands up to regular walks. Consider whether illumination is passive (reflective trim) or active (LED elements), since each offers different advantages for distance and battery life. Practical details like quick-release buckles, easy-clean fabrics, and leash attachment points make nighttime use smoother and safer for both handler and dog.
