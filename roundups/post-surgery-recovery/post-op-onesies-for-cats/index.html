Look for breathable, soft fabrics, flat seams, and designs that allow wound access for checking or dressing changes. Fit and adjustability matter: secure closures prevent slipping and chewing without restricting breathing or circulation. Practical details like machine-washable construction, ease of application, and compatibility with feeding and toileting make daily care simpler.
