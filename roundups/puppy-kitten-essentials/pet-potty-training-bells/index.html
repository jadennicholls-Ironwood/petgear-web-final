Durable materials and a pleasant chime encourage repeated use, while adjustable mounting and magnetic or adhesive attachments suit varied door and wall setups. Some bells are designed for high-traffic doors, while others hang at paw level for very small pets; select the style based on training location and the animal’s temperament.
