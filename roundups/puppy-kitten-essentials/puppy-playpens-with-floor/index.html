Soft, waterproof floors protect surfaces and speed cleanup, while rigid, elevated bases help keep puppies dry and reduce chewing. Look for secure latches and reinforced panels to minimize escapes and ensure long-term durability for playful pups. Portability and quick setup matter for training sessions and travel, while non-slip bases boost safety during high-energy play.
