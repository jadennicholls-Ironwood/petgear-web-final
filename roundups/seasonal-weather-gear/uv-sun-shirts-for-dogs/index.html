Look for breathable, quick-dry materials that block UVA/UVB while allowing airflow to prevent overheating. Stretch and adjustable closures help maintain coverage during walks and play, keeping dogs comfortable without restriction. Additional features such as reflective trim, machine-washable construction, and easy sizing make daily use practical for active households. Scan the Buyer’s Guide below to compare fabrics, fits, and protective details that match your dog's activity level and coat type.</p><h2>Buyer’s Guide</h2><h3>PlayaPup Dog Sun Shirt, USA Made , Honu, 2X-Large</h3><p>PlayaPup Dog Sun Shirt, USA Made , Honu, 2X-Large in UV/Sun Shirts for Dogs aims to deliver balanced day-to-day performance.
