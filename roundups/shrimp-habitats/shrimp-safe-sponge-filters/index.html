Durable, aquarium-safe materials and modular designs that fit planted or shrimp-specific setups reduce maintenance and protect delicate juveniles. Low-noise operation, simple disassembly for rinsing, and compatibility with standard airline tubing or small internal pumps make long-term care easier. Filter size, sponge firmness, and mounting options influence how well a unit blends into an aquascape and provides nursery zones for shrimplets.
