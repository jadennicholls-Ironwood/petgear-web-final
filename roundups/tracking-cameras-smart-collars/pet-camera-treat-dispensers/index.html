Reliable battery life, robust mobile apps with secure cloud storage, waterproof hardware, and comfortable collar design matter as much as advanced features like geofencing and activity insights. Prioritize systems with intuitive notifications, customizable treat schedules, and training modes that turn technology into practical behavior support. The right combination can reduce separation stress, reinforce training remotely, and provide caregivers with measurable activity and location data.
