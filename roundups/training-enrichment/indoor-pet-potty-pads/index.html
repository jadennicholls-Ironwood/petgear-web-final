Enrichment-focused pads can include textured surfaces or attractants that encourage reliable placement and support behavior shaping. Practical convenience features &mdash; like adhesive backing, fast-dry top layers, and compact disposal design &mdash; cut down on maintenance and keep living spaces fresher. Consider environmental impact and non-toxic components to protect household health while supporting long-term training.
