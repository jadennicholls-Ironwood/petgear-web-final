Durable materials and water-resistant finishes hold up better on outdoor adventures and make cleaning faster after dusty hikes. Stability on uneven roads, tether compatibility for harnesses, and adequate padding are key factors for minimizing stress and injury during movement. Size and installation should match your console layout so the carrier doesn't obstruct controls or storage, while still allowing easy reach.
